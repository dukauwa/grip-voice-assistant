This limit does not restrict the total number of meetings you can hold during the event‚Äîit simply limits the number ofpendingrequests you can have at once. Once a meeting request isaccepted,declined, orcanceled, it no longer counts toward your limit, allowing you to send out another request.The purpose of this limit is to improve the overall event experience by preventing excessive or arbitrary meeting requests, which make the event more difficult to navigate or be seen as spam. It also ensures that all participants have a fair chance to send meeting requests and manage their schedules effectively.Where Can I See My Pending Meeting Limit?You can easily track your remaining pending meeting requests directly from the platform.On the WebWhen you are about to request a meeting, the number of remaining pending meeting requests will be displayed at the bottom of the"Request a Meeting"screen, as well as on the Edit Profile page.Tip: If you hover over this number, you will see a brief explanation of how the limit works and the total number of pending requests allowed.On the Mobile AppOn the mobile app, you will get notified about how close you are to reaching your pending meeting limits on your Edit Profile page, and of course when you request meetings.Example: A user may have 20 pending meeting requests left, which will be displayed clearly at the top of the screen.What Does the Pending Meeting Limit Mean for Me?The pending meeting limit refers to how many meeting requests you've created that are in apendingstate (waiting for acceptance) at any given time.A meeting request is only consideredpendingif it has not yet been accepted, declined, or canceled.Once a request is accepted, declined, or canceled, it no longer counts toward your pending meeting limit, allowing you to send another meeting request.What is a purpose of a Meeting Organizer Limit?Themeeting organizer limitcontrols how many meeting requests you can personally request overall during the event. If a meeting request isdeclinedorcanceled(by you or the recipient), it no longer counts toward your limit, allowing you to send out another request. If the meeting isacceptedorpending, it will be deducted from your Meeting Organizer Limit.Where Can I See My Meeting Organizer Limit?On both Web & Mobile you can see your curent limit when requesting a meeting, and on the Edit Profile screen.Meeting organizer limits can currently only be set on individual participant level, while pending meeting limits are set on data-type level (i.e. for all profiles within that data type).In situations where both of these limitations are configured for the same participant, the Meeting Organizer limit takes precedence.When Meeting Organizer limits are active, you currently cannot reschedule a meeting someone invited you to - simply because if would makeyouthe organizer. In this case, it's best to reach out to the meeting organizer via the chat function and have them reorganize the meeting.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)Q: If my pending meeting limit is 'X', does that mean I can only have 'X' meetings during the event?A:No, the limit only applies to pending requests. You can have as many meetings as you want once requests are accepted or declined.Q: Can the pending meeting limit be changed during the event?A:Yes, the event organizer can modify the limit, but any existing meetings that exceed the new limit will remain valid.Q: How do I know how many pending requests / meetings to organize I have left?A:The number of pending meeting requests remaining is shown at the bottom of the"Request a Meeting"screen.

Title: Similar Profile Recommendations

URL: https://support.grip.events/similar-profile-recommendations

Content:
Similar Profile RecommendationsWhen viewing a participant, company or item profile, you will see a 'Similar Profile Recommendations' box on the right hand side of this page, shown in the image below. This delivers suggestions of participants, companies, or items similar to the profile you're viewing at the time. This gives you an even more personalized experience through the platform and of course, increases the opportunity for finding those perfect business opportunities.How we recommend similar profilesHere are¬†the things we take into account when recommending similar profiles:Custom profile valuesInteractionsJob titles (participants only)The language in which a participant is accessing the platform (Participants only)What is the difference between similar profiles and recommendations?Quite simply, recommendations are based on your interactions within the event platform (your preferences), Custom Profile Field profile values (completed when onboarding), and your behaviour within the platform) whereas similar profiles are recommended based on the profile that you are looking at and will not change with your own platform interactions.Similar profile recommendations are currently not supported on mobile.

Calendar SyncIn this article we‚Äôre going to learn about the calendar sync feature, which allows your participants to sync all their sessions and meetings to their personal calendars. We‚Äôll explore the various ways they can set up the sync, how it'll be displayed on their calendars, and some tips and advice to get the most out of this feature.We‚Äôll cover:What it is and how it worksHow to sync your calendarOn webiCalGoogleOutlookYahooOn mobileWhat's included in the meeting descriptionWhat's included in the session descriptionAutomatic updatesTimezonesFAQsWhat is the calendar sync feature?Many of us live by what‚Äôs in their Google calendar. When we‚Äôre at an event, we may not want to be checking our event schedule to figure out where we need to be. As such, we allow users to sync their event schedule to Google, iCal, Outlook and Yahoo. At the point a user decides to sync, all their meetings and sessions will appear in their calendar. All subsequent meetings and sessions will then appear automatically, for both this event and any future events in this app.How to sync your calendarNote:Make sure you to check your calendar's 'out-of-office' and/or 'auto-response' settings to prevent meetings from being declined automatically.On web:To enable calendar syncing on the web platform, follow these steps:Go to the 'My Schedule' page on the web platform.Click on the 'Sync to my Calendar' dropdown.Select the calendar application you use.Once you‚Äôve selected the correct calendar, a url is generated for your schedule. You‚Äôll be taken to the correct place in the relevant calendar to save this.iCal1. Click subscribe, when the url modal appears.2. Name your calendar and make sure to set auto refresh to 5 minutes. Otherwise it will take some time for new meetings and sessions to appear in the calendar.3. The calendar will appear in the left-hand list. Make sure it‚Äôs checked for it to be visible.Google1. Click ‚Äòadd‚Äô when your calendar url loads onto Google.2. Make sure it‚Äôs checked on the left-hand list for it to be visible.OutlookTip: Make sure that you arelogged into Outlook before syncing your Grip Schedule with Outlook calendar, to make sure sync works well.¬† Take into consideration that they have aknown issueon their platform when logging in.For Outlook users, here are the steps to ensure your sessions and meetings are visible in your calendar:Start by naming and importing your calendar.After importing, you might see a window that suggests your calendar hasn't saved. Don't worry, it's saved. Close this window and move your calendar to the date of your first meeting or session, and they should become visible.If your sessions and meetings are still not visible, make sure to check your calendar on the left-hand side.YahooFor Yahoo users, you can't be directly taken to the calendar-saving option. Instead, follow the instructional web page, and we'll guide you through the process of copying the calendar link on that page.On mobile:iOS:On iOS all you have to do is open the ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù tab on your app and you‚Äôll see a new banner on top that says ‚ÄúSync to your calendar‚Äù. Tapping on that button will open a new popup that will allow you to sync your calendar.As soon as you press the ‚ÄúSynchronise‚Äù button the link will open and your calendar app will open with the option to subscribe and name your calendar. If you skip or you‚Äôre simply not interested in syncing your calendar at the moment, you can always go back and do it from your ‚ÄúMore‚Äù screen inside the app.Android:On Android the steps are similar with one tiny difference - once you open the ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù tab in your app you will see the banner on top that says ‚ÄúSync to your calendar‚Äù.Tapping on that button will open your default system calendar app (Samsung Calendar on Samsung phones, Google Calendar on Google phones) and show you the list of events that will be imported, once you tap on "Save" the calendar events will be imported in your calendar app.If you skip or you‚Äôre simply not interested in syncing your calendar at the moment, you can always go back and do it from your ‚ÄúMore‚Äù screen inside the app.What's included in the meeting description?Everything you need for your meeting can be found in the meeting description, which includes:The meeting status - whether it‚Äôs pending, accepted or cancelledEach meeting attendees with a link to their profileEach meeting attendee‚Äôs company with a link to their company profileThe custom profile fields that appear on each attendee‚Äôs profile within the web platformThe meeting link (if you‚Äôre at a virtual event)What's included in the session description?Relevant information for your session can be found in the event description, which includes:Session locationA link to the session web pageSession descriptionSession speakers with links to their profilesSession sponsors with links to their profilesAutomatic updatesAny updates to meetings or sessions (except updates to CPFs) will appear automatically in the calendar. For example if a meeting status changes, or a sponsor is added to a session, this will be reflected in your calendar.However, it is worth mentioning that the amount of time these changes take to appear in the calendar, varies depending on the calendar in question.iCal: When the calendar is synced, as long as 5 minute auto-refresh has been selected, any updates will appear within 5 minutes.Google: Updates take 24 hours to appearOutlook: Updates take 3 hours to appearYahoo: Updates take 8 - 12 hours to appearTimezoneMeetings and sessions will display in the timezone of the calendar. For example, if the event is in Paris, but the user is in London, meetings and sessions will display in the London timezone. In the rare instance a user has manually updated their calendar timezone themselves, the meetings will display in whatever the timezone has been set to.FAQsDoes the calendar sync work across all events within an application or just one event?The calendar sync update works across all events within an application.When does the sync button show for Hosted Buyer? During provisional phase or only at the final phase?The sync button will show throughout Hosted Buyer, regardless of the phase.Is it enabled/disabled on an APP or an EVENT level?It's enabled/ disabled on an app level.Are the calendars listed above the only ones I can use?Yes, at this time these calendars are the only ones we support.When I send a session to my calendar, will this be in the event timezone or will it change?The event will always be in the timezone the event is taking place in. Your calendar will display this in whichever timezone you have your calendar setup to. For example, if an event is taking place at 5pm UTC (GMT) and you are based in New York (UTC-4) this may show in your calendar as 1pm.My iCalendar on MacOS is not opening automatically when I use Calendar Sync anymore, how can I fix this?With the recent update on MacOS your calendar settings may have changed the default calendar app to something else (Google Chrome as an example). To fix this you need to go to your iCalendar app, open Settings and change the "Default calendar app" to "Calendar.app"

Title: Cross-Event Networking

Cross-Event NetworkingCross-Event Networking allows the participant experience to be seamless and coherent for attendees participating in multiple, separate events.In this article, we'll cover:Cross- event actions: how actions in one event will affect anotherCross -event connections: how connections between attendees are retainedAttendee recommendationsMustMeet eventsUltimately, the aim is to ensure that a community can be built over a series of events, which makes networking much easier and builds good relationships over time.Cross-Event ActionsThe networking actions we‚Äôre discussing here are classified asShow InterestandSkip. A participant canShow Interestin orSkipanother participant by using the buttons on the web platform, or the swipe actions on the mobile application.These actions become relevant if Attendees participate in future events with some of the same Attendees from previous events. For example Attendee A and Attendee B participate in an event in 2023 on the Grip platform. Then, the event organiser invites them both back to their next event in Grip, and those actions will affect the connection between the participants.Attendees can have a unique set of actions in any given event. Of course, if those actions result in a Connection to be formed with another Attendee, the Attendees will remain a Connection in any following event that they both participate in.Attendee A can markInterestedon Attendee B in Event 1Attendee A can take aSkipaction on Attendee B in Event 2 (if they didn‚Äôt Connect in Event 1)If Attendee A marksInterestedagain on Attendee B in Event 1, this will override the action taken in Event 2Connections will be displayed on Profile Lists, Profiles Details, and Connections SidebarCross-Event ConnectionsConnections must be created in the same event rather than cross-events. See example below:Attendee A shows interest in Attendee B in Event 1Attendee B shows interest in Attendee A in Event 2Result: No connection createdAttendee A shows interest in Attendee B in Event 1Attendee B shows mutual interest in Attendee A in EventResult: Connection createdAttendee RecommendationsAttendees can be recommended more than once if they weren't swiped on.Attendee A is recommended to Attendee B in Event 1Attendee B swipes on Attendee A but no other action is taken on either sideNo connection is createdAttendee A can then be recommended again to Attendee B in Event 2MustMeetAttendees can always provide a new Preference to any Attendees in any MustMeet event.Attendees that have marked preferences on Attendees in previous events are expected to mark their preferences in future events, regardless of whether they‚Äôre already Connected to those Attendees.¬†This is because MustMeet events rely heavily on this ‚Äòintent‚Äô data in order to schedule meetings that attendees are happy with. It is entirely possible that Connections may want to meet year-on-year, and so these preferences can make that kind of intention clear.If you have any questions or suggestions you can reach out to us onsupport@grip.events

Title: Networking Requirements for Video Calls

URL: https://support.grip.events/networking-requirements-for-video-calls

Content:
Networking Requirements for Video Calls*As of October 2021, Grip Web Networking is no longer supported on Internet Explorer due to Microsoft announcing that they will be sunsetting the browser come June 2022Grip uses WhereBy which relies onWebRTCfor its Video Calls, a framework that uses peer to peer (p2p) connections and MESH networking. With these types of connections, audio and video data streams are sent directly between two or more user devices. This can be a great way to send data for smaller groups, but it relies on a fast internet connection and minimal latency. As more users join in on the call, more network speed and bandwidth is required.We don't currently have a way to measure exactly what the required speed of the connection is between each of the callers, but we can recommend some average network speeds that are suggested for WebRTC products like ours! In general: the higher your internet speeds, the better quality of video and audio you will receive.Meeting TypeRequired SpeedsNotesOne on One MeetingsAt least 2.0 Mbps outbound and 2.5 Mbps inbound or higherFour or more participantsAt least 3.2 Mbps outbound and 3.2 Mbps inbound are requiredDue to the way peer to peer connections are designed, the more participants you add to the call the higher bandwidth you will need.LatencyFor latency, you will want to make sure you are experiencing less than 100 ms on your network for the best experience. Up to 400 ms is acceptable, but not ideal for high-quality conversations. You can check your latency by running aPingtest orTraceRoute.Network Configuration & SecurityFirewallIf you or your company use a firewall, you may experience some connection problems depending on your firewall settings. For a smooth experience, we recommend:Opening port 443 for¬†outgoing traffic for both TCP and UDP.Additionally, outgoing traffic should preferably be direct and not sent through a proxy.VPNRight now we don't recommend using Whereby with a VPN. Because our service is peer to peer, not having a consistent IP address can cause problems connecting to rooms, or in some cases a specific guest in the room. Our recommendation is to turn off your VPN when having a Whereby¬†conversation, and then turn it back on after finishing the meeting.Quick AnswersWhat should I do if I'm experiencing connectivity problems?It's a good idea to try out a few different networks to rule out the possibility of a WiFi issue. Switching to a different router or trying an ethernet connection may resolve the issue, so this is the first recommendation. If you're not able to resolve the issue, be sure to look at ourtroubleshooting article.Using Wifi or EthernetPoor WiFi connections are the biggest cause of quality and connectivity problems with Whereby. In many cases, the connection may be fast and stable enough at the modem, but a bad router or excessive traffic on the router can cause problems in the call. In an office environment for example, a router may be overloaded due to the number of computers connecting. So if this is the case, we recommend using Ethernet.

Title: Grip Calendar Integration and Timezones

URL: https://support.grip.events/grip-calendar-integration-and-timezones

Content:
Grip Calendar Integration and TimezonesIn this article, we explain how Grip deals with timezones as part of our calendar integration.Grip offers an excellent feature with calendar integration, including Google, Microsoft Outlook (and outlook.com), Office 365, Apple Calendar, and Yahoo. However, timezones can sometimes cause confusion for users when they utilize calendar integration.Event Timezones and Local TimezonesThe key to understanding this integration is to differentiate between the timezone of the event and your current local timezone. For example, if you are in London and you are viewing an event taking place in New York, there is a timezone difference.When you access the Event Agenda and add a session at 3 pm to your schedule, you expect this 3 pm time to reflect the time of the session in New York, not in your local London timezone.The same concept applies to meetings. When you request a meeting for 4 pm at the event, you anticipate this to be 4 pm in New York, not in London.Event Timezones and Your Personal CalendarHowever, this rule can be problematic when syncing meetings with your personal calendar. Most personal calendars are smart enough to always display meetings in your local timezone.For instance, if you have a meeting scheduled for 3 pm in New York a few weeks from now, and you are currently in London, your personal calendar will show this meeting at 8 pm. This adjustment is made because there is a 5-hour time difference between London and New York.This situation is illustrated in the screenshot below for a meeting in New York while the person is in London.The top red box shows the "timezone-adjusted" time in London for the meeting, while the second red box displays the meeting's time in New York.This brings us to the second rule: Grip Meetings in your Personal Calendar will be time-zone adjusted based on your current local timezone.Event Timezones and Virtual EventsThe above-mentioned rules required further adjustment for Virtual Events. Displaying times in event timezones can be problematic for scheduling meetings and attending live-streaming sessions, as attendees may be in various local timezones.Therefore, a third rule is introduced: For virtual events, the times within the Grip Matchmaking Solution are time-zone adjusted based on the user's current local timezone.To implement this rule, the following changes have been made:Time in Event Agenda and My Schedule pages are displayed in the local timezone of the user, with the timezone indicated in the top right corner of the schedule list.On schedule lists, you can check the session time in the event's timezone by hovering the mouse over the hour display. The time displayed is based on the session or meeting room location.Local timezones are also displayed on the session and meeting details.This concept also applies when requesting meetings for yourself or for a colleague using Grip Teams, as well as when providing your availability for the event.

It is editable, can have special characters, and can be used for multiple events.It is set initially when the event is created in the ‚ÄòDisplay Name‚Äô box when the ‚ÄòCreate New Event‚Äô button is clicked. It can then be edited by clicking the ‚ÄòRename Event‚Äô button towards the bottom of the page.The 'display name' is the name that appears on:Automated EmailsDashboard event cardDashboard Event/App DropdownSwitch Event in Web NetworkingAPI Tokens pageAdmin Access PageGrip Sign Up PageTop Search Bar in Mobile AppIn the [app_name] variable on login screenTeams Invite Acceptance PageIf changed, it will affect all of the above.System NameThe 'System Name' is used for technical elements of the event.

Personal user data is never included in widgets.Widget examples: how event platforms use widgetsWidgets are commonly used across event websites to create an integrated, user-friendly experience. Below are some typical examples of how event organizers incorporate widgets into their platforms:Homepage PromotionEmbed the event agenda or speaker list directly on the homepage to give visitors a preview of what‚Äôs happening and encourage registration.Microsites for Tracks or ThemesUse pre-filtered agenda widgets to create dedicated pages for specific topics, audience groups, or session types.Exhibitor and Sponsor HubsDisplay searchable lists of exhibitors, sponsor representatives, or product showcases, embedded within partner or sponsor pages.Venue and Floorplan OverviewsEmbed interactive venue maps or floorplans to help attendees plan their visit or navigate on-site events.Speaker LineupsShowcase speakers or moderators using grid or list view widgets, linked from promotional or program pages.Login or Networking Landing PagesInclude call-to-action buttons in widgets that link to networking tools or login portals for attendees.Widget embedding guidelinesWidgets automatically scale to the container size on your website. Use adynamic heightto ensure they display well across screen sizes.Note: if you embed a widget in a very tall section, pop-ups like session details may appear lower than expected. This is because the widget centers them vertically within the total space. To prevent this, keep the widget section height reasonable.FAQsQ: Under the Navigation Items menu in the dashboard, what does "Private" mean under Widgets visibility?A:Ifa NavigationItemis marked asPrivate,it will not be visible within a Widget. Only NavigationItems marked as public can be displayed externally. Personal event data‚Äîsuch as networking matches, personalized agendas, or custom profile fields‚Äîcannot be shownin widgets for privacy and security reasons.Q: Can I embed multiple sections of my event into my website?A:Yes!

Title: How to configure Monetisation Plans

Content:
How to configure Monetisation PlansThis article outlines the use of Grip Monetisation Plans, which can be used to up-sell¬† Companies/Sponsors/Exhibitors based on extra functionality on the Grip Platform.In this article we will cover:Configuring your monetisation plansFAQsConfiguring your Monetisation PlansUp tothreeplans can be configured for your event. You must make at least one plan a 'default plan' otherwise your data types will have unlimited access to all features.It is important to note, that Monetisation Plans act as an add-on to existing settings and not an override. For example, should there be an Event Inbound Lead limit of one and one Banner Ad, and a user purchases a monetisation package, which provides an Inbound Lead limit of two but no Banner Ad is included, then the user will get an Inbound Lead Limit two and also a Banner Ad.1. Create your plansThe first thing you have to do is create your plans which representwhocan buywhat, atwhichprice. The following variables are available for the creation of a plan:Name (Something short and easy such as 'Premium' or 'Enterprise')Currency (Choose between USD, EUR and GBP)Available Types (Choose which data types can purchase this plan such as Exhibitor Representatives)Default Plan (If this is your cheapest plan that people should be automatically subscribed to, make sure you toggle this ON)2. Pick your plans' featuresThe features that can be included in the different plans fall into the categories below:Hiding Profile Fields-¬† Choose which fields won't be visible to other people on the platform. For example, people on the Basic plan not having a Company Image.Metadata Value Limits- Choose for individual metadata how many values can be selected. For example, limiting Exhibitors on the Basic plan to only two Products Provided.Enhanced Networking Capabilities -Set a limit on the amount of Leads can be shown on a certain and a multiplier on the Pending Limit. For example, if a Basic Exhibitor can have 10 pending meetings you can increase this with 2 for the premium plan so that each rep can request 20 pending meetings.Leveraging your Company Profile -Give Exhibitors additional visibility by choosing one of the 4 Promotion options:Featured Label behind the Company Name.Boosting the Company Profile to the top of the Exhibitor list.Inclusion in the footer of emails being sent from the platform (welcome emails, engagement emails, meeting invites).Sidebar promotion on the web platform.Maximum number of Items -Set a limit of how many Profiles someone can add to their company. For example, for a Fashion trade show, there might be a limit of 2 Brands and 5 Products on the Basic Plan while on a Premium plan I can create 10 Brands and 50 Products.3.¬†Review your Plans & PaymentSign in as a Data Type that has access to the Monetisation Plans and go to Teams > Account > Upgrade. Press on 'Upgrade' when viewing the plan.*Do not make a payment, as this will automatically be invoiced*4.¬†Upgrade MessagesThere are several places where we strategically try and persuade people to upgrade. The most important ones are:1. Inbound Leads2. Hidden Meetings3. Metadata Value Limits4. Reaching the Pending Meeting LimitFAQs1. Can I setup features of monetisation plans, without allowing people to upgrade?Yes, as long as theCompany Profilesall have their own data type. You can make sure that there is no upgrading available between different monetisation plans. For example, you could have one user type called 'representative' with two company types called 'Sponsor' and 'Partner'. In this situation, the monetisation plan set up would look like the below:The rule is as follows: Plans are assigned based on the Company, upgrading is available based on the User and their ability to access different plans.2. Can I add multiple types in the 'Maximum number of items' category?Yes, this section is not limited to one type called 'Product'. You can add multiple data types in this section, e.g. 'Product', 'Brand', 'Press Materials' etc. By adding them as part of a monetisation plan, all these items will become available to be added, viewed, edit and delete by Team Members in the Teams interface.3.Can I prevent all Leads from being viewed within Teams?No - but you can prevent 2 or more from being viewed, which is effectively the same. If you add a limit of ‚Äò0‚Äô in the Leads section of your Monetization plan, the Leads for Teams on this plan will not be limited at all. You must instead add a limit of ‚Äò1‚Äô. This will allow one initial Lead to be processed as normal, but all further Leads for those Teams will be hidden as expected.

Title: Guest and Anonymous access

URL: https://support.grip.events/guest-and-anonymous-access

Content:
Guest and Anonymous accessThe Guest and Anonymous User feature allows you to expand your event's reach by enabling easier access for users who may not want to go through the full registration process.This guide will help you integrate this feature into your events, ultimately boosting engagement and opening up new opportunities to convert hesitant users into enthusiastic attendees.In this article, we will cover:Overview of Guest and Anonymous accessHow to control access optionsHow to customize the login experience for your Guests and Anonymous UsersHow to tailor permissions for your Guests and Anonymous UsersHow to manage guests and anonymous usersKnown gaps and limitationsFAQsOverview of Access OptionsGuest AccessA Guest user is a non-authenticated user who can log in with a valid email address. The email must be in a correct format, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be verified or real.Anonymous UserAn Anonymous User does not need to provide an email address to log in. This type of access removes barriers, making it even easier for users to join your event.What Can These User Types Do?Guests and Anonymous Users have unique properties that differentiate them from other user types. For example, Guests allow event organizers to capture email addresses, while Anonymous Users do not require any contact information. Additionally, you can set up permissions to offer these users a preview of the platform and prompt them to buy a ticket if they want full access.How to Control Access OptionsTo allow Guests and Anonymous Users to log in, the event organizer must enable these settings for each event. If your application uses SSO, refer to the FAQ section for more details.How to Customize the Login Experience for Guests and Anonymous UsersEach event's settings will inherit the login configurations from the application level, but you can modify them for individual events. Key points to consider:Disabling access at the app level will turn it off for all events.Modifying event settings will break the inheritance until the next app-level change.If you turn off access, existing users will be logged out, and new Guests or Anonymous Users won‚Äôt be able to log in.When enabling Guest or Anonymous User access, you must provide URLs for your privacy policy, terms & conditions, and optionally, your imprint statement.Customizing the "Buy A Ticket" PromptIf you enable Guest or Anonymous User access, you will need to create a custom prompt that appears when these users attempt actions restricted by their permissions. These prompts support multiple languages and can be customized for each event. If your event doesn‚Äôt include an option to register or purchase a ticket, the prompt will still appear but without a purchasing option.Once configured, they will look similar to the following examples for your Guests and Anonymous Users.On web:On mobile:How to Tailor Permissions for Guests and Anonymous UsersGuests and Anonymous Users have more restricted permissions than regular users. In addition to "Yes" or "No" options, you can choose to prompt these users to register or buy a ticket when they attempt to perform an action that is not available to them.Permissions available for prompting:Editing their availability calendarEditing their profileViewing profiles of a specific User TypeSeeing matchmaking recommendations for a particular User TypeViewing sessions of a particular trackJoining sessions of a particular trackGuests can receive emails and notifications, while Anonymous Users can only receive notifications.Permissions not available for Guests and Anonymous Users:Forming connections or chatting with other User TypesBeing met by or meeting other User TypesBeing recommended to or viewed by other User TypesAppearing in search resultsCreating or joining teamsScanning badges or receiving badge scansAdditional limitations:Joining GroupsParticipating in Speed NetworkingExperiencing OnboardingSetting a password or changing their email addressWhat other features are not available only to Anonymous Users?Receiving emailsHow to Manage Guests and Anonymous UsersYou can manage Guests and Anonymous Users in the Grip Dashboard, just like regular Data Types. You can search, filter, and sort through profiles, view details, and perform actions such as:Changing the data type of a profile (e.g., moving a Guest to a regular user type)Reviewing user activity dataResetting recommendations or creating manual recommendation swipesRemoving a profile from an event or applicationAdding a profile to a sessionFor Guests, you can also export data on known conversions from Guest to regular users, tracking when a profile changes data types.Known Gaps and LimitationsPermissions:The user interface for managing some permissions will be improved over time.Demographic Information:Custom profile fields can be edited by Guests if enabled, but only Event Organizers can view this data.Event Access and Experience:Regular users who are also guests in another event will maintain access as guests until manually removed by an Event Organizer.Privacy and Security:Guest login may be halted to prevent security breaches, particularly if a user had a previous account that was never activated.To prevent any data breach of this user‚Äôs account information, the event organizer needs to take any of the following three options.Add the user as regular user to this year‚Äôs event and send a welcome emailRemove the user from the previous event and let the user enter as a guest in this year‚Äôs eventDelete the thing record completely and let the user enter as a guestFAQsManagementQ: Can I enable Guest or Anonymous User access in my Application?A: Yes, but you will need to contact your Grip staff representative to enable it for your Application. Once it‚Äôs enabled, you can manage it independently for each of your events.Q: Can I enable Guest or Anonymous User access in my MustMeet event?A: Yes, you can enable this feature. We recommend activating it only during the Open Networking phase to maintain control over participant interactions.Q: Can I rename these new user types?A: Yes, you can change the display names for Guest or Anonymous User types. However, keep in mind that these users won‚Äôt appear in the regular user experience.Login, SSO, and RegistrationQ: My Application is SSO protected. Can I still enable Guest or Anonymous User access?A: Yes, Guest and Anonymous User access is compatible with SSO-enabled applications.Q: I want guests to sign in only using my SSO. How can I set this up?A: You can configure Guest Login by disabling the ‚ÄúGuests can bypass my Application's SSO‚Äù option during the Guest access setup.Q: I don‚Äôt require guests to sign in using my SSO. What should I do?A: Simply enable the ‚ÄúGuests can bypass my Application's SSO‚Äù option when setting up Guest access.Q: Will there be guest records in Grip that aren't in my SSO records?A: Yes, this means you could have user records on Grip that don't match your SSO system.Q: My Application uses Grip Registration or Grip Sign Ups. Can I enable Guest or Anonymous User access?A: Yes, Guest and Anonymous User access is compatible with Grip Registration and Grip Sign Ups.Q: What does a valid email address mean for Guests?A: A valid email address allows Guests to log in. The email must be in an acceptable format but doesn‚Äôt need to be verified or real.Q: Why don‚Äôt you verify guest email addresses?A: Requiring email verification would increase the barriers to entry for your event, which could reduce participation.User Experience for Guests and Anonymous UsersQ: Will Guests or Anonymous Users go through the onboarding experience?A: No, Guest and Anonymous Users will not see the Onboarding process.Q: What happens if I turn off Guest or Anonymous User access?A: Guests and Anonymous Users will only be able to log in if the Event Organizer enables these settings for their event. If access is turned off, existing users will be logged out, and no new Guests or Anonymous Users can log in.Q: What if a guest in one event is a regular user in another event?A: They will retain access to the ‚Äúguest‚Äù event. However, Event Organizers will need to manually remove the user from the event via the Grip Dashboard if necessary.Q: Will Guests and Anonymous Users receive emails?A: Guest Users will receive emails since they log in with an email address, but Anonymous Users will not.Q: Will Guests and Anonymous Users see Ads, Promotions, or Sponsors?A: Yes, they will be able to view these as part of their event experience.Q: Can Guests and Anonymous Users join sessions?A: Yes, if you set the permissions for them to do so.

What Are Custom Groups and How Do They Work?In this article, we‚Äôll explain how Custom Groups work in Grip. You'll learn how to create and manage Custom Groups, set permissions, and explore common use cases such as separating Hybrid and Virtual participants in events.A Custom Group in Grip is a way to organize different profiles within the platform. It‚Äôs useful for grouping participants with different permissions or separating them by category. For example, in hybrid events, Custom Groups can differentiate between Hybrid and Virtual participants under the same Data Type. This impacts profile tags and meeting availability (virtual, in-person, or both). We'll cover more use cases and details below.In this article we will cover:Understanding the Custom Groups pageHow to create a Custom GroupHybrid Event SetupNative Lists SetupMustMeet SetupHow to add Data Types and profiles to Custom GroupsHow to delete Data Types and profiles from Custom GroupsHow to edit a Custom GroupFAQsUnderstanding the Custom Groups PageNavigate toEvent Settings, then click onCustom Groups.If no groups have been set up, the page will be blank. ClickCreate Custom Groupin the top right to get started.How to Create a Custom GroupHybrid Event Setup:ClickCreate Custom Group.Enter theGroup Name. Please note for events with multiple languages enter translations as well.Select whether the group isHybrid,Virtual, orNot Specified.If you're managing aHybrid event, consider creating two custom groups:Hybrid(for participants with access to both in-person and virtual features)Virtual(for participants with access to virtual features only)This will add a tag to each participant‚Äôs profile, indicating whether they are a Virtual or Hybrid attendee. It will also determine the available meeting locations:Hybrid participants will see both in-person and virtual meeting rooms.Virtual participants will only see virtual meeting rooms.This functionality is available on both web and mobile.ClickCreate Groupto complete the setup.Custom Groups for Native Lists Setup:Custom Groups can also be used to separate profiles within navigation lists. For example, on the Exhibitors list, you can separate'Premium' exhibitorsfrom'Standard exhibitors'.Tip: use this on mobile and web platforms.To create Custom Groups:ClickCreate Custom Group.Enter theGroup Name. If your event supports multiple languages, add translations.If your event is set toHybrid, you will see theHybrid Group Accessdropdown. SelectNot Specifiedfrom the options. For in-person or virtual-only events, this option will not appear.No further settings are required (additional settings apply only to MustMeet events).ClickCreate Groupto finish.To add Custom Groups to a navigation list:Go toEvent Detailsand click on theNavigation Page.ChooseNative ListunderItem Type, select the relevant Data Types, and then assign your Custom Groups.This setup will display the custom groupings in the platform's navigation, both on web and mobile. For more details, check out our [Navigation Items article].Note: This can be done for any 'Native List' within navigation items.MustMeet Event Setup:To create Custom Groups:ClickCreate Custom Group.Enter theGroup Name. If your event supports multiple languages, add translations.InMustMeet events, additional settings allow you to configure recommendations, profile visibility, and similar profile displays. You can also configure unstructured metadata if needed."New group can see recommendations of": Select the Data Types from other groups that will be recommended within the platform. Leaving this blank will have no effect."New group can see profiles, search and see lists of": Limit what this group can view by selecting specific Data Types."New group can display similar profiles": Toggle this to allow or prevent similar profile recommendations. If a Data Type is shared across groups and the feature is turned off in any group, it will disable similar profile recommendations for that Data Type across all groups, even if enabled elsewhere.How to Add Data Types and Profiles to Custom GroupsClickViewnext to the group, then clickAdd Itemsto search for and add profiles or Data Types.Alternatively, you can go to theDatatab, select a Data Type, and choose the profiles you want to add. Use the checkbox to select all items on the page.Another method is to click into a profile on the dashboard. On the right-hand side, you‚Äôll see aCustom Groupsbutton. Click it to open a screen where you can add the profile to a Custom Group.How to Remove Data Types and Profiles from Custom GroupsClickViewnext to the group, then use the checkboxes to select profiles you want to remove. ClickRemove from Group.To remove a specific profile, open the profile under Data tab, navigate toCustom Groupson the right, and clickRemove.How to Edit a Custom GroupUnder Event Settings / Custom Groups clickViewnext to the group, then clickEdit Groupat the top. This will bring up the same fields you used to create the group, allowing you to make any necessary changes.How Group Permissions WorkCustom Group permissions were designed primarily for use in MustMeet event, though they can be used in normal events too.Custom Group permissions are set individually per group and allow the Event Organizer to specify other groups that members of a group can see, or be recommended. They only ever apply to profiles that are in a Custom Group - if a profile is not a member of any Custom Group, then they are not affected by group permissions in any way. There is an example below which should help explain this further.Group permissions sit above data type permissions, so they act as a sort of second filteron topof any data type permissions that have been set already. They will not allow group members do anything that their data type already restricts them from doing, so you can effectively only further restrict permissions by adding more at the group level.ExampleYou have two data types in your event, Attendees and Representatives. Data type permissions allow each data type to only see and be recommended members of the other data type, so Attendees cannot see other Attendees.You then create two Custom Groups, Group A and Group B. Each group contains a mix of attendees and representatives. There are also some attendees and representatives that arenot part of anyCustom Groups.Group A's permissions allow its members toonlysee and be recommended members of Group B, and vice versa.Data Type Attendee - Group AThis participant can only see and be recommended Exhibitor Reps that are part of group B,andExhibitor Reps that are not part of any group.Data Type Attendee - not part of any GroupThis participant can see and be recommended every Exhibitor Rep in the event.Data Type Rep - Group AThis participant can only see and be recommended Attendees that are part of group B,andAttendees that are not part of any group.Data Type Rep - not part of any GroupThis participant can see and be recommended every Attendee in the event.This will be the same in reverse for members of the other group.FAQsWhat Data Types can I add to a Custom Group?Any Data Type can be added to a Custom Group.How many Data Types can I have in a Custom Group?There is no limit to the number of Data Types in a Custom Group.Can a profile be in multiple Custom Groups?Yes, profiles can be assigned to multiple Custom Groups.If I use Custom Groups in a list with the ‚ÄúDisplay profiles outside of custom groups‚Äù option off, will only Custom Group data be shown?Yes, only data within the Custom Group will be displayed.

How to Configure a Multi-Language Event?We ensure that every event participant has a seamless experience, regardless of their language or location. Our platform supports multiple languages, allowing event organizers to configure events with various language options and date formats.At Grip, we believe that every event participant deserves an equal experience regardless of their native language or location.In this article, we will cover:How to configure a multi-language eventSetting Language Preferences for Event ParticipantsWhere and What to Translate on the Grip DashboardFAQsHow to configure a multi-language eventEnabling multiple languages for your event is an add-on feature that can be activated internally. To incorporate this feature, please contact your Grip representative for assistance.Supported LanguagesGrip currently supports several languages across the web networking platform and mobile app. You can view the full list ofsupported languages, dates, and time formatshere.If you require a language that is not currently on the list, additional configuration and translation work will be needed.Steps to Enable Multi-Language SupportStep 1:Speak to your Grip contactTo enable multi-language support, reach out to your Grip contact, who will initiate an internal request to configure the desired languages at the application level.Step 2:Configuration by GripThe Grip Delivery Manager will raise an internal configuration request to enable the selected languages. If a language is not already supported, additional configuration will be required, along with the necessary translations.What to Expect After Multi-Language Support is EnabledOnce the multi-language feature is activated, some key elements of the platform will be translated automatically. These include foundational components such as login buttons, user settings, and system dialogs.However,customizable event-specific elements‚Äîsuch as homepage blocks, navigation items, and session descriptions‚Äîmust be manually translated. You‚Äôll need to provide these translations to ensure a fully localized experience for attendees.Setting Language Preferences for Event ParticipantsThere are two main ways to set a participant's preferred language:Via the Grip Dashboard:Manually set the preferred language in a user's profile.Use a bulk upload process via spreadsheet.Through an integration with your registration platform.Via the Web Platform (Participant-side):Participants can update their language preferences directly through the language settings on the web platform.Important:The language preferences from a participant‚Äôs device settings do not automatically update their language for communications, such as emails or notifications.Best Practice:During Registration:Collect language preferences during the registration process so that they can be set during the data import into Grip.Post-Registration:If language preferences aren‚Äôt collected during registration, encourage participants to update their language settings on the web platform or set the user‚Äôs preference in the Grip Dashboard manually.Note:Language preferences cannot be updated directly through the event‚Äôs mobile app at this time.Where and What to Translate on the Grip DashboardWhen configuring a multi-language event, there are several areas in the dashboard where translations need to be added manually. Any text box with a flag icon indicates that translations can be provided. If left blank, the system defaults to English.Tip:Whenever you see a flag in a text box it means that translations can be provided for that field.

How do I use the event template library?Learn how to launch a new event using pre-configured templates in Grip‚Äôs event template library.This article explains how to create an event using Grip‚Äôs event template library. It also provides guidance on selecting the most suitable template for your needs and ensuring compatibility with your application setup.The event template library offers pre-built event configurations that can be easily copied into your application. This feature is especially useful for organizers new to Grip or those looking to save time when launching a new event.In this article, we will cover the following:Use casesBefore you beginFinding the right templateCreating your eventFrequently Asked QuestionsUse casesThe event template library supports the following scenarios:Event organizers launching their first event in GripTeams within an organization managing multiple events with similar structuresEvent organizers seeking inspiration for new formatsEvent organisers looking for quick, ready-to-launch configurationsThe library provides instant access to pre-built events that are nearly ready to launch. Users can simply select a suitable template, create the event in their Grip application, customize the branding and upload their event data.The template library allows you to search and filter across a curated range of events, which include optional features and configurations that have been created after feedback and successes measure from real events.Note:If a template includes features that are not available in your current Grip license, they will be ignored during setup. A list of optional features will be displayed during the template selection process.Before you beginBefore creating an event using a template, ensure your application on Grip Dashboard includes the following:At least a few basic data types (e.g., Participant, Company types)Access to the Events page in the Grip dashboardNote:If you‚Äôre using a brand new application or don‚Äôt have data types configured, contact your Grip delivery manager for assistance. Every template requires data types in order to copy the correct settings.Finding the right templateWhen you're ready to create an event,Open your Grip dashboard and go to theEventspage.ClickCreate new event, then selectChoose from template library.You'll see a list of event templates that you can browse through, or you can use the search bar and filters to refine your selection. Clickingon a template brings up its details, including multiple images, a description, and any important notes that you should be aware of.What's really important is the list of attributes shown below the description - these are really helpful to narrow down the category of event you want to create. Checking these attributes can tell you what kind of audience the event was configured for, along with key features like Mobile support. You can see the same list in filters at the top of the library once you have a sense of what you need.Tip:Use the attributes section to match a template to your event goals. Filters at the top of the page mirror these attributes to help refine your search.Templates may also show ‚Äúrelated templates‚Äù based on similar features or structure. These are useful if the initial option doesn‚Äôt meet your exact needs.Creating your eventAfter selecting a template:Click 'Use template'.Grip will automatically validate the template to ensure it‚Äôs compatible with your application setup.If successful, proceed to the next step in the event creation flow.If you encounter an error during validation:Carefully read the error message. It may indicate missing data types or feature mismatches.Return to the library to select a different template, or contact your Grip representative to enable the necessary data types.From this point onwards you follow the same steps as listed in the article forcopying events from different applications, where you map the data types in the template to those in your application, and then choose optional features.Once you've added in the final details you're ready to start using your new template!Ensure that you spend a little time updating the branding and messaging to fit your event's style, and that you log in before launching to be certain everything looks right.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: Why do I need more data types to use a template?A: Features in Grip are tied tightly to the data types that are in the event. Permissions, custom fields, relationships, teams... all are configured on a data type-level and we need to transfer those settings onto a data type in your application. In Grip, you can have Item types, Company types and Participant types, all having slightly different properties, and the Grip licence you have will dictate how many data types you're permitted. If you don't have enough of a certain data type, you'll need to speak to your Grip team contact for assistance.Q: I want a different kind of template that's not listed, what should I do?A: If you're looking for something that's not available in the template library, let us know! Get in contact with your Grip team member and we may be able to create a template in the future to fit your needs.

These links dynamically adapt to the event participant, ensuring they are taken to destinations specific to their needs. For example:Personalized Registration Management: Direct event participants to their own registration or ticket editing pages.Custom Itineraries: Provide participants with a link to their personalized event schedule on an external platform.Session Interaction Links: Automatically log event participants into third-party Q&A or polling platforms by embedding credentials within the URL.By using personalized URLs, you can efficiently create variations of the same base link, tailored to each participant's profile.Example use case: personalized travel itinerariesImagine creating a unique travel itinerary for each participant, hosted on a dedicated website:Base URL:https://travel-event.com/itineraryPersonalized URL Format:https://travel-event.com/itinerary/For each event participant, theirThing ID(a unique identifier in Grip) is appended to the URL:https://travel-event.com/itinerary/1036518https://travel-event.com/itinerary/1036519With personalized URLs, participants can click a single navigation item in Grip and be directed to their own travel page without additional input.How to create a personalized URLIf a URL supports personalization, Grip provides options to insert custom fields or profile data directly into the link. Follow these steps to create a personalized URL:Open the URL input field: Whether you‚Äôre creating a Navigation Item, Session URL, or another personalized link, start by entering the base URL into the provided field.Insert custom fields:Below the input field, you‚Äôll see a list of available custom fields or profile data fields.Click on any field (e.g.,Thing ID) to insert it into the URL at your cursor position.Customize and save: Once the URL is complete, review it for accuracy and clickSave.Enabling custom fields for personalized URLsTo use a custom field in personalized URLs, you‚Äôll need to enable it in the custom field settings. Onlyfreeform custom fieldsare supported for this purpose.Steps to enable a custom field for URLs:Go to the custom fields section: Navigate to theCustom Fieldsarea in your Grip dashboard.Edit or create a freeform custom field: Open the settings for an existing field or create a new freeform field.Enable personalization: Toggle the option for ‚ÄúProfile field can be used in personalized URLs.‚ÄùRestrict visibility: To avoid confusing participants, disable the visibility and editing options for this field.Save changes: ClickSaveto finalize your settings.Tip: Ensure that the data you plan to use in the custom field is accurate, unique for each participant, and properly formatted (e.g., no spaces or special characters).FAQQ: How can I test personalized URLs?The best way to test is to create a test registration. Use your registration platform to populate the relevant custom fields with realistic data. This ensures the integration with Grip works as expected. Once the test registration appears in Grip, click on the personalized URL to confirm it redirects to the correct destination.Q: My personalized URL isn‚Äôt working. What should I check?Review the URL Setup: Verify the link construction in the URL input field.Check Profile Data: Open a participant‚Äôs profile and confirm the custom field or profile data used in the URL is correct.Test the URL: Combine the base URL with the participant‚Äôs field value manually to test if it loads correctly.Correct Data Format: Ensure custom field data does not contain spaces or unsupported characters (e.g.,#,%). If issues persist, update the data in your registration platform.Q: Can I use multiple custom fields in a single URL?Yes! You can include multiple custom fields in one URL. Simply insert additional fields into the appropriate sections of the link during setup.

Data types are separated by their names and their permissions - so it's common to link them to different event ticket types, where certain types of attendee are able to access different things in an event.Data Types are grouped into the following categories:Participant (event participants who will be able to login and access the platform)Companies (company profiles that can be linked to participants)Items (entities that can be linked to companies, to showcase any product, service, or other information)Understanding the Event Data Types pageThis is the page that lists all of the Data Types that have been added to your event. It also allows you to add, remove, and edit any Data Type on your event.It is worth noting that Data Types need to be created at the application-level by Grip admins, so on this screen you can only add or edit existing Data Types.#NameFunction1Data Type IDThis shows the unique identifying number assigned to this Data Type2[X] System nameThis is the name of the Data type in the dashboard3[X] Display nameThis is the name of the Data Type that will appear across the platform.4Participants Data Type TabClicking on this opens the list of all Participant Data Types in your event4Companies Data Type TabClicking on this opens the list of all Company Data Types in your event6Items Data Type TabClick on this opens the list of all Item Data Types in your event7Number of profilesThis number shows the number of Profiles within the Data Type in your event8SettingsThis column allows you enter the settings for the selected Data Type9Add Participant Data TypeThis allows you to add an additional Data Type to your eventHow to add a new Data Type to your eventYou cannot create a new Data Type at event level, instead Data Types are created at App level and assigned to an event.

This can be done as a total profile lock, or can be set field by field, and it can be applied to any data type - participants, companies or items.If you prefer that your event participants edit their registration details outside of Grip, then it's recommended that you restrict editing in Grip. It's confusing to have more than one place to update your details, and with many integrations it's crucial to have 'one source of truth' so that data is being accidentally overwritten!Ensure that you leave editing open for any field that's not part of your registration process so that your participants have the option to change what they need to.Profile editing control at Grip is granular; you can choose any individual field on any data type to lock, including things like profile pictures and email addresses. Note that custom fields have their own dedicated editing control too, and you can manage all of this from the tabs on the data type settings page.For data types that are companies and items, these restrictions are applied on the company and item edit pages in Teams. Note that if you've disabled editing to at least one field for items, team members will not be able to create new items directly in Teams, as it's assumed that creation is happening externally to Grip.Default profile fieldsOn the second tab of the data type settings page for any data type, you'll see a list of the 'default' profile fields available, along with some descriptions. These do not include any custom fields that have been assigned to the current data type, as they're controlled on the third tab.To restrict editing, enable the toggle at the top of the page, "Restrict editing on X profiles" and click Save.This will do the following:Prevent editing by event participants on all fields listed.Add a default message to the Edit screens on web and mobile, informing users that fields are locked.We recommend that you customize the message shown to your event participants. Simply write your own message explaining why you've locked certain fields and where they can go to make changes.If you have an external registration system where changes can be made, you can add a link to it here for easy access. This link can also be personalized with the participant's data, so that you can create a link that jumps directly to the user's personal (external) edit profile page.Please seeour personalized URL articlefor details on how to personalize a link.On the table below, you can allow editing over individual fields for total control.Custom profile fieldsThis tab shows all of the custom fields currently assigned to this data type, along with their settings. Please see themain Custom Fields articlefor details on this page and its functionality.

Title: How do I upload profiles using a spreadsheet?

URL: https://support.grip.events/how-to-use-the-csv-uploader-to-add

Content:
How do I upload profiles using a spreadsheet?Save time when creating multiple profiles by using a spreadsheet templateIn this article we'll cover the bulk profile uploader, which is a tool that allows you to quickly add or update profiles in your Grip event, directly from the dashboard. With this tool, you can create/update participants, companies, and items through a spreadsheet file which is automatically generated. All you need to do is copy and paste data into the appropriate fields and upload the file to the dashboard.We also have a bulk uploader for Sessions, which you canread about here.In this article, we will cover:Use cases and informationUsing the bulk profile uploaderFilling out the upload spreadsheetUploading your completed spreadsheetUnderstanding separatorsUsing Special fieldsFAQUse cases and informationThe uploader was created to give you the ability to quickly create or update profiles in bulk. This feature allows you to take an automatically-generated template, fill it out, and then upload it back into the platform to quickly add data to your event.Its primary purpose is to add profiles to events, however you can also use it to update profile information or take actions on large numbers of profiles at once - for example adding 50 speakers to a Custom Group in your event.Using the bulk profile uploaderSelect an event, if you haven't alreadyNavigate to the Data section of the Grip DashboardSelect the Data Type you want to add or make changes toIn the right-upper corner click on the button "Create [data type name] profiles"From the drop-down menu pick ‚ÄúUpload in bulk via spreadsheet"Downloading the right templateNote that if you‚Äôve already downloaded a template, you can skip to the upload step.The first step is to select the template that's right for your needs. There are two scenarios to account for:I only want to add profilesthat have already been createdto the current event.Choose the simplified template.I want to add/create brand new profiles or update existing profiles with new information.Choose the full template.You can click on the 'Template Fields' dropdown to see a list of the information that is contained within each template.Here are some important points to consider regarding the upload options available:Unique Email Addresses: Each profile must have a unique email address. This email is used to check for existing records in your Grip application to prevent duplicates.Unique Registration IDs: Registration IDs must be unique within your Grip application. Avoid using special characters like "<>#@()!/\, etc., and spaces.Multiple Events: You can have multiple events within the same Grip application. Profiles may already be added to some events and not others.Notes on the .CSV file typeThe spreadsheet that is downloaded will be a .csv file type, which any spreadsheet software can open. It's important that youdo not save the spreadsheet as a different file formatafter you've added information to it, as you then won't be able to upload it again. Again, the vast majority of spreadsheet software can export or save a spreadsheet as a .csv file.It's also important that you don't change the layout of the spreadsheet - like removing header rows. This will likely mean that you'll see errors when trying to upload the sheet again, so try to leave the structure the same as when it was downloaded initially. That said, it IS ok to remove some columns if you want to, as long as they're not marked as mandatory, just be sure you don't need them at all.For issues using CSV files,see our article here.Once you've downloaded a template, you can move to the next step.Filling out the upload spreadsheetOn the second step, you'll see that the page is split into two halves. We'll start with the right-hand side, which contains useful information that you might need to complete your template.Each one of the four tabs is filled with information from your current event, showing available languages, sessions, groups and custom field data. Every table contains a column called "Value to use in spreadsheet", which shows the data that you would need to add to your spreadsheet in order to use this data. To make things as easy as possible, you just need to click on a cell in one of these columns to copy its data, so that you can paste it straight into your spreadsheet.Here are some examples of actions that would need you to copy and paste this data into your upload spreadsheet:Setting a profile's preferred languageBy copying and pasting a language code from the table into theUser preferred languagecolumn on your spreadsheet, you can ensure that welcome emails are sent in that language to that participant, before they even log into the platform.Adding profiles to SessionsUse the copied value in the columnsAdd to Session as Speaker(or as Attendee, or Sponsor) to rapidly assign sessions to individual participants. You can add to multiple sessions using a symbol-separated list of values (seeUnderstanding separatorsbelow).See theSpecial fieldssection for more examples of this kind of bulk action.Adding custom profile field data to profilesTo ensure that the information you're uploading matches the information already created in the event, you can click to copy the custom field data for any predefined field. For parent/child profile fields, the full path of each value is copied so that you can copy directly into the spreadsheet.Uploading your completed spreadsheetOnce you have downloaded and filled out a template, you can begin uploading the spreadsheet back into the Grip platform. The left-hand side of the page contains some useful options and is where you can upload your file.1. First, pick an upload method:Add and create new profiles (recommended)Adds any profiles with a matching email address to the current event, while updating their information with the data contained in your spreadsheet.Note that changes to basic fields (like Name, Headline, Job Title etc) will reflect in other events in your application, as these fields are shared.Creates new profiles that don't already exist in your Grip application.Skips profiles that are already part of the current event.Add, create and update profiles already in eventThis is the same as the first option apart from that it also allows you to update profiles that are already in the current event.Useful if you have made a mistake and want to correct information en mass, or if you want to perform a bulk action like adding existing speakers to sessions.2. Then clickSelect fileto choose the right CSV file on your computer.3. Lastly, make sure you choose the rightseparator symbolto match what you've used in the spreadsheet - or ignore if you haven't uploaded multiple values in any field.4. ClickContinueto move to the next step.Review upload resultsOn the last page, view the number of profiles added/updated successfully and those that failed.If you're happy, clickView uploaded profilesto go back to the data types list - note that for large uploads, it will take a little time for the registrations to go through.Handle failed profilesIf you see that some profiles have not uploaded, you can download a report providing¬† the reasons for failure.Usually this is due to missing required fields or duplicate records. Correct any mistakes on the spreadsheet and then re-upload the file.Understanding separatorsSome fields can handle multiple values at once - like theAdd to Groups (by ID)column, or any of your multi-select custom profile fields.If you want to include multiple things into one cell in a spreadsheet, we need to understand where one value ends and the next begins. With some kinds of data this can be difficult - for example, if your data already has symbols in it, like commas.The bulk uploaders in Grip allow you to choose a separator from a list of three, so that you can more easily manage multiple values like this:When filling out your spreadsheet, just make sure you use one of these symbols consistently, wherever you need to input multiple values inside a single spreadsheet cell.When uploading your completed spreadsheet, make sure you pick the right symbol so we know how to split up these values.Special FieldsThere are a number of special fields that can be used to perform certain functions while profiles are imported or updated. Note that the available fields will depend on the type of data you‚Äôre trying to upload. Here's a rundown of the fields, what they do, and how they can be used.Add Meeting Locations (by name)Available for: Participants, CompaniesThis field is used for assigning Meeting Locations to profiles - the most common use cases being assigning Company profiles to their booths within an expo or connecting a Participant profile to a Meeting Location for MustMeet events.This is a freeform text field, into which you need to add thenameof the meeting location(s) you'd like to create or assign.If a meeting location exists already with the same name, the profile will be added to it. If no meeting location exists with that name, one will be created, and will have the event's Default Meeting Settings applied (in the dashboard under Networking > Meetings > Meeting Locations > Default Location Settings).You can also write a comma-separated list of location names if there is more than one - e.g. ‚ÄúBooth 1, Booth 2‚Äù.Add to Group (by ID)Available for: Participants, Companies, ItemsThis field adds the incoming profile to one or more Custom Groups which is essential for MustMeet or Hybrid events. Each Custom Group created in Grip has an ID which is what needs to be imported in this field.A common mistake is to add the group‚Äôs name into this field, make sure you use the ID. You can check the upload page for a list of Group IDs to use.You can also write a comma-separated list of Group IDs if there is more than one - e.g. ‚Äú1234, 0987‚Äù.Add to Session as SpeakerAvailable for: ParticipantsAddingSession Registration IDsto this field will mean that the incoming profile is added to that Session as a Speaker. Custom contributor roles are not supported, but of course profiles can be switched between roles later via the dashboard.Session Registration IDs can be created externally when sessions are imported, or automatically if a Session is created in Grip. You can find them in the dashboard when looking at a session - not to be confused with theSession ID, which is not used in this way.You can add multiple sessions by entering a comma-separated list of Session Registration IDs.Add to Session as AttendeeAvailable for: ParticipantsSimilar to the above, adding Session Registration IDs to this field will mean that an incoming profile is added to that Session as an Attendee. This is the same action as a participant adding a Session to their Schedule, so in effect, this is a way to pre-assign sessions.You can add multiple sessions by entering a comma-separated list of Session Registration IDs.Add to Session as SponsorAvailable for: Participants, Companies, ItemsAgain, as above, this field adds the incoming profile as a Headline Sponsor to Sessions. You can add one or more Session Registration IDs separated by commas, but bear in mind that a Session can only have one Headline Sponsor.Monetization Plan IDAvailable for: CompaniesThis field is used to pre-assign a Monetization plan based on its ID. This means that when the Team is created for this Company profile, the Team will be automatically assigned a particular Monetization plan, matching the ID in this field. See ourMonetization articlefor more details about plans.Monetization plan IDs can be found in the dashboard on the Monetization page, next to each plan. You can only assign a single ID for this field - e.g. "231".FAQQ: The dashboard is telling me I haven't filled in Email/Reg ID/Name, but I have!This is because your template is not up to date, and may be missing the latest data. The best option is to download a fresh template from the dashboard.If you've already done that, then your browser will have 'cached' the old template, so clear your browser's cache before downloading a new template. You'll know that it's correct if you see asterisks (*) next to the Email/Reg ID/Name columns.You can also try adding the asterisks to the downloaded template yourself, manually.Q: Is it possible to create Meeting Locations or Booths using a CSV spreadsheet?Yes! You can use a CSV upload to create and/or assign new or existing Meeting Locations to a profile. Read more about ithere.Q: Will uploading a new file overwrite existing relationships?A:Any upload that includes anExhibitor ID (or sharer_id)willregenerate relationshipsfor that profile. This appliesregardlessof whichUpload Methodyou select:"Add and create new profiles""Add, create, and update profiles already in event"What determines whether relationships are updated is theinformation in the spreadsheet itself, not the upload method.

Content:
Configuring Teams in the Grip DashboardThis guide provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to set up, configure and manage Teams in the Grip Dashboard. Once the event platform is launched for participants, Teams will be available for them to access and use.In this articleConfiguring data types that can join a teamSetting up how members can join a team (joining options)Setting a team size limitConfiguring monetization (optional)Adding data on the Grip DashboardWhat is the Exhibitor ID?How to manually add relationships between profilesManaging individual teams in the Grip dashboardProfile tabRelationships tabPlans tabFAQsTeams is configured at thecompany data type level,meaning that settings applied to a specific company type will affect all companies within that data type.ExampleIf an event has a company data type called"In-Person Exhibitor", and a company profile named"Amazing Startup"belongs to this type, thenany settings applied to "In-Person Exhibitor" will also apply to "Amazing Startup."However, these settingswill notaffect other company types (e.g., "Sponsors" or "Partners" data type profiles).How to enable TeamsWithreal-time AppSync updates, users who join a team mid-session now gain instant access to keyGrip Teamsfeatures, such asLead Qualification. Previously, team membership was checked only at login or event switch, causing delays‚Äîespecially for users accessing"Claim Your Team"from the homepage. Now, users can join a team without needing to log out or refresh the platform.To enable Teams for yourExhibitors, Sponsors, or Companies(depending on how companies are labeled on the platform):Go toEvent Details > Event Data Types > Companies.Click thesettings gear iconfor the company data type where you want to enable Grip Teams.EnableTeams for that company type.Select which participant types can join teams.A participant type must have anactive relationshipwith the company type to be selectable.If no relationship exists, the participant typecannotbe selected.Note:Ensure relationships are activated between:Company ‚Üí Participant(e.g.,"In-Person Exhibitor" ‚Üí "In-Person Exhibitor Rep")Company ‚Üí Product(if products need to be visible in teams)5.¬† ¬† ¬† Enable Company Chat (Optional)If enabled, company chat will be available on theweb platformto use for all company representative profiles under this company type.More details on Company Chat.Configuring data types that can join a TeamYou can controlwhich participant types (who can join)anditem types (what is visible)are allowed in teams.1.

Choose the option that works best for your event.1. Invite members via email(Best for adding attendees in non-ticketed events)How to enable:Go toGrip Dashboard > Event Details > Event Data Types > Companies.Select thecompany data typeyou want to configure.UnderJoining Options, select"Invite Members via Email."ClickSave.How it works for Team admins on event platform:On theevent platform, team admins will see the"Invite Members"button underTeam > Team Members.They enter theuser‚Äôs email address, first and last name, and job title.If the user isnew, the admin must select theirrole(Team AdminorTeam Member).The user receives aninvitation emailand must accept to join the team.2. Invite Members on Platform(Best for adding attendees from within the event)How to enable:Go toGrip Dashboard > Event Details > Event Data Types > Companies.Select thecompany data typeyou want to configure.UnderJoining Options, select"Invite Members on Platform."ClickSave.You can also add an optional external registration invite link here too - see Option 3 below for more details.How it works for Team admins:On theevent platform, team admins will see the"Invite Members"button underTeam > Team Members.They cansearch for userswho are already registered and on Grip Dashboard for the event.Only users with anallowed participant type (set up under first step who can join Teams)will appear in search results.Once invited, users will be added to the team.Alternatively, they can copy the external registration invite link and pass it to their colleagues to register for the event.3. Invite via External Registration Link(Best for events with exhibitor registration options)How to enable:Go toGrip Dashboard > Event Details > Event Data Types > Companies.Select thecompany data typeyou want to configure.UnderJoining Options, select"Invite via External Registration Link."Enter the external registration link (e.g.,https://my-registration-form.grip.events). This should be a link to whichever registration platform or system you use.ClickSave.The external registration link can be personalized -see this articlefor more details on link personalization.Assuming that the registration platform that you use supports it, this would allow you to create a registration link that's specific to each Team, so that a value can be passed to the registration system and take the attendee to a link dedicated to that Exhibitor. This is very helpful for ensuring that the resulting registration has the right data when it reaches Grip, meaning the new attendee can be automatically connected to the right exhibtor profile, or if certain exhibitors have things like coupon codes in your registration system.How It Works for Team Admins:On theevent platform, team admins will see the"Register New Members"button underTeam > Team Members.This method works withthird-party registration systemslikeTitoorBizzabo.Users register through theexternal linkand, if supported by the registration platform you use, can beautomatically addedto their team.This requires theregistration systemto haveExhibitor IDsand/or compatible data.Note:This option isnot yet available for Grip Managebut is planned for future updates.4. Disable Team Invites(Prevents new members from joining Teams)How to enable:Go toGrip Dashboard > Event Details > Event Data Types > Companies.Select thecompany data typeyou want to configure.UnderJoining Options, select"Disable Team Invites."ClickSave.What happens when this is enabled?On theevent platform, the"Invite Members"button underTeam > Team Memberswillnotbe visible.No new userscan be invited to Teams.Existing team members retain access, but no further invitations can be sent.Setting a team size limitTheTeam Sizesetting allows you to define the maximum number of members in a team. This option is available only when either"Invite Members via Email"or"Invite Members on Platform"is selected.How to set a team size limitEnsure that one of the supported invitation type methods is selected.Enable theTeam size limittoggle.Enter the desired team size (between1and999members).Save your settings.Key considerations:The team size setting is not available for "Invite via External Registration Link."Since external registration systems manage sign-ups, Grip cannot enforce a team size limit in this case.For "Disable Team Member Invites," a team size limit is not needed.When this option is enabled, all team invitations are blocked, so setting a limit is unnecessary.Team size limit restrictions on the event platformOn the event platform,team admins cannot invite additional members once the team size limit has been reached.When this limit is reached:The"Invite Members"button under theTeam Membertab withinTeamswill begreyed out, preventing further invitations.Only team adminswill see this button in a disabled state.Team members will not see the button at all, as they do not have permission to invite members.Important note:Theteam size limit only applies to invites sent within the event platform. Itdoes not applyto team members added manually through theGrip Dashboard or API.This means that if a new registration includes the correctExhibitor ID, the user will still be added to the team‚Äîeven if the team has already reached its size limit. Registration data is considered valid and cannot be restricted by the team size setting.Managing team size for an individual TeamIn addition to setting a event-wide team size limit,Grip Dashboard admins can adjust the team size limit for individual teamsthrough theGrip Teamssettings page in the dashboard.If anevent-wide team size limithas been set underEvent Details > Event Data Types > Company > Settings > Team Size, it will automatically apply to all teams within the event. This limit can be viewed underGrip Teams > Teams.Dashboard admins can override this limit for individual teamsby navigating toGrip Teams > Teamsand adjusting the limit for each team separately.Note:Themost recentteam size limit always takes precedence, whether it was set at theevent level(Event Details > Event Data Types > Company > Settings > Team Size) or at theindividual team level(Grip Teams > Teams).Configuring monetization (optional)Monetization and teams play a crucial role in the Grip Teams setup process. Here's how it works:Monetization allows you to control which features are accessible to teams or specific data types.For your event, you can configure up to three different plans. These plans define the available features and options.It's essential to have at least one "default" plan in place. Without a default plan, all data types will have access to all available features.It's crucial to understand that Monetization Plans serve as an extension of your existing settings rather than as an override. Here's an example to illustrate this concept:Let's say your event has an Event Lead limit set at one and provides one Banner Ad by default. Now, a user purchases a monetization package that offers an increased Lead limit of two but doesn't include an additional Banner Ad. In this scenario, the user will receive the upgraded¬† Lead Limit of two and still retain the original Banner Ad.For more detailed guidance on configuring monetization plans, you can refer to ourdedicated articleon this topic.Adding data on the Grip Dashboard (Exhibitor ID / Relationships)After setting up Teams, data must be added to theGrip Dashboardto ensure the Team setup is correctly configured and working as expected.What is the Exhibitor ID?TheExhibitor IDis aunique identifierthat automatically links:Company profilestocompany representativesCompany profilestoitems(such as products, if applicable)TheExhibitor IDensures that relationships between companies, representatives, and items are createdautomaticallyon theevent platform.Key considerationsThe Exhibitor ID is requiredto link profiles automatically.If a profile does not have an Exhibitor ID, you must manually add the relationship.Manually adding relationshipscan takea lot of time, especially for large events.How to manually add relationships between profiles (ideal for testing and one-off cases)If relationships are not automatically established, you canmanually link profilesby following these steps:Go toGrip Dashboard > Data.Select the profileyou want to edit (company, participant, or item).Scroll to theRelationshipssection within the profile.Click"Add Relationship"and manually link the profile to its corresponding entity.This method is best fortestingormaking one-off adjustmentsrather than handling large amounts of data.For more details on managing data profiles, visit:Overview of Profile Pages on the Grip DashboardManaging individual teams in the Grip dashboardImportant: To ensure that all leads are captured effectively, please encourage your company representatives to activate their Team on the web event platform as soon as possible.Once teams are configured and event platform has been, you can manage them individually from theGrip dashboard > Grip teams > teams.Key features:Profile tab‚Äì edit team details, including name, industry, location, and images.Relationships tab‚Äì manage team members, join requests, and associated products.Plans tab‚Äì adjust a team‚Äôs monetization plan without requiring an upgrade from the event platform.Accessing Teams list in the Grip DashboardGo toGrip Dashboard > Grip Teams > Teams.Here, you will see alist of all Teamscreated on theevent platform.Click on aspecific Teamto view and manage its settings in more detail, but have in mind that team membership is instantly updated when a user joins.Profile tabWhen you select a team, you will land on theProfile tab (alogside there are 2 other tabs explained below - relationships and plans), where you can see/edit key details:Team NameCompany NameHeadlineIndustryLocationSummaryImageNote:These edits function similarly tomanaging a company profileunder data on Grip Dashboard.Profile preview and team size per individual teamOn the right side of the page, you will find:Profile preview‚Äì An overview of theteam‚Äôs products, participants, and custom fields.Team size limit‚Äì Super Admins can modify this limit if needed.Actions: Managing a Team‚Äôs Status & DataOn theright-hand side, at the top of the page, under theActionssection, you will find six key tools tomanage Teams and their datain the Grip Dashboard.1.

Why Grip requires ExhibitorIDs to link Companies & RepresentativesThe vast majority of clients want Grip to link Companies to Representatives as is shown in the below mockup. This article explains what is required from a data point of view to achieve this.Bill Gates and Satya Nadella are both representatives of Microsoft. On the left bottom, we can see both users as representatives, on the right we can see the ability for me (Tim Groot) to request a meeting with one of the companies representatives, Bill Gates in this case.Data Requirements for Exhibitor / Representative LinkingIn order to achieve what is shown on the above screenshot foreveryexhibitor and representative record imported into Grip, a so-called ExhibitorID needs to be present.This¬†ExhibitorID¬†is what will enable Grip to link the Exhibiting Company with the Exhibiting Representatives. ThisNEEDSto be done from the imported data at the current moment in time and isNOTsomething that can be done manually inside Grip after data is imported.The ExhibitorID is present on both the company record as well as the¬†representative record. They could be sitting in the same or different systems which doesn't matter from a Grip perspective as long as they both have the ExhibitorID "ASDF1234"

Everything You Need to Know About: Interactive Floor Plan - ExpoFPGrip has the ability to take your floor plan and make it come to life by adding functionality and making it more interactive for your attendees. This article will cover everything you need to know about the Interactive Floor Plan and our Floor Plan Partner, ExpoFP.What is an Interactive Floor Plan?Why ExpoFP?Requirements & Timeline For an Interactive Floor PlanRequesting a Change to an Interactive Floor PlanFrequently Asked QuestionsWhat is an Interactive Floor Plan?An Interactive Floor Plan takes a simple floor plan and adds functionality to it making the floor plan feel more immersive, and engaging for attendees. Grip partners with ExpoFP to create Interactive Floor Plans that can be fully integrated within Grip to include features as such:Multi-level Way-finding- Find where an Exhibitor or Room is located & get directions to that location from where you are currently standing on multiple levels.Indoor Positioning(paid add-on)- Location intelligence and indoor positioning (blue dot) using multiple methods such as GPS and BLE beacons.Outdoor Positioning- Location intelligence and outdoor positioning (blue dot) using multiple methods such as GPS and BLE beacons.Exhibitor Profiles- Exhibitor profiles (logo/ name / description) when you tap on a booth as well as a subset of exhibitor categories which will be available in ExpoFP as filters.Sponsored Exhibitors- Increase visibility for premium exhibitors with logos on the floor planAdditional Features include:Offline ModeBuilt in search engine to simply finding ExhibitorsCan be embedded into your websiteCan be live for up to 6 weeks prior, during and post eventWhy ExpoFP?We have partnered with ExpoFP because of the powerful features that they bring to the table.ExpoFPis a floor plan solution that was developed for the trade show and expo market. It's a vertical in that it can be used by an organizer from the ground up, to plan a floor, create booths and sell the space on a floor plan through a self-service or managed sale. The final output is a completely up to date floor plan which is the single point of truth for exhibitor booths.Requirements & Timeline For an Interactive Floor PlanTo request a floor plan build you‚Äôll need to confirm which package you would like to use and what add-ons you might want to include with your Grip Account Manager and Project Manager. The items we require to begin creating the floor plan are below:Events withmorethan 250 booths: floor plan file format should beAutoCADEvents withlessthan 250 booths: we can acceptPDF/PNG/DXF/SVGfile formatsDXFfile should have booths as polylines or polygonsTotal number of booths on the floor planExhibitor logos on booths inSVGformatExhibitor logos on map and profile inPNGorSVGformatTotal number of exhibitor logos on the mapBooth labels / ID on one line (no multi-line)Booth label stating within the polygon to which they are attached toOnce Grip has received all of the materials from the organizer, your Project Manager will submit the information to ExpoFP which then ExpoFP creates the Interactive Floor Map. Once the floor plan is complete, ExpoFP will send this file back to Grip where the Project Manager will have the Grip Integrations team create the link between Exhibitor profiles and Exhibitor booths on the floor plan.This process will take ~12 business days (over 2 working weeks), but if you are flexible with your project timeline add extra time to account for delays.Process for all floorplans is as follows:Floor plan ready and created by ExpoFP within5 business daysof reception of all required materialsBooths linked between Grip ‚Üî ExpoFP (Grip Profile to Floor Map) within5 business daysby the Grip Integrations team.This process happens once ExpoFP has created the Interactive Floor Plan and sent it to Grip.Once the integration has been set up by the Grip integration team booth changes on the Grip dashboard will be reflected on the floor plan.Wayfinder added to the floorplan by ExpoFP within2 business daysfrom the day Grip ‚Üî ExpoFP integration has been set up.Requesting a Change to an Interactive Floor PlanOnce the Floor Plan has been created by the ExpoFP team, organizers will be able to instruct 2 major updates and 2 minor updates to the floor plan (or alternatively organizers can choose an ExpoFP training with the Client Success Manager and can handle minor updates themselves). The Project Manager and/or Client Success Manager will be responsible for tracking this and liaise with ExpoFP for these changes.We will try to flag it to the organizer if we see this going over the change limit so the organizer can make a decision on how to proceed. Any changes over/past this limit will be charged for.Major changes are considered to be(implemented within 5 business days)Floor plan layout changes ( >5% change to floor plan layout)Adding routing to floor planMinor changes are considered to be:(implemented within 24 hours)Adding an extra boothRenaming of public locations and POIsFrequently Asked QuestionsQ: In what order do exhibitors show on the sidebar, lists, etc?A: AlphabeticalQ: How is distance, travel time and estimated arrival calculated?A: The distance is calculated using units of measurement in the designer and the arrival time is calculated with the assumption that a person has a speed of 5 km/h.Q: Can I see what attendees click on the floor plan?A: Yes. You can see information about attendees and their activity by using Google Analytics. Get in touch with Grip PM/CS to get this set up. Or you can simply add your GA / GTM code under Event Settings -> Google Analytics ID (which accepts both old style GA and GTM ids).Q: How can you embed the floor plan on your website using Grip Widgets?A:To embed thefloor planon your website using Grip Widgets, follow these steps:Mark the Floor Plan navigation item as Publicin the Grip Dashboard.Enable it as a Widgetby configuring it under theWidgetssection.Use the embeddable codeprovided in the Dashboard to place the Widget on your website.Q: What does 'category' mean within the search bar?A: This is a special Custom Profile Field you setup for your event.

Early access encourages attendees to use the platform to plan meetings and schedule sessions.5. Appoint Internal Points of Contact/Ambassador(s)Identify and communicate internal points of contact (ambassadors) within your team to help promote Grip. These contacts can demonstrate the platform to exhibitors and assist with any inquiries. Additionally, consider adding the sales team to the platform as extensions so exhibitors can connect with them directly before and during the event.6.

Title: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning delivered by Grip

Content:
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning delivered by GripIn this article, we will explain how Grip uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology to better connect participants to one another, services and products. You will also find some top tips on getting the best from Grip‚Äôs AI-powered tools to improve your attendee, exhibitor and sponsor experience at your events.OverviewGrip has the world‚Äôs leading AI-powered matchmaking and networking platform; many years of hard work and research has gone into this complex and constantly evolving recommendation system.At Grip, our approach is to make betterrecommendationsbased on a participant'spreferences(what kind of people they want to meet, or the types of things they‚Äôre interested in.) Matching interests of attendees with suppliers that can deliver on those interests is a simple way to make accurate recommendations. We refer to this aspreference matching.So, let's explain the difference between ‚Äòexplicit‚Äôand‚Äòimplicit‚Äô preferences.Explicit preferencesare preferences that a participant hastoldour AI about. To discover these preferences, some organisers will ask their attendees questions on which types of products or services they‚Äôre looking to find at the event, through registration forms or onboarding questions.If the organisers don't ask their participants to provide their preferences, or the participant simply hadn‚Äôt told them their interests, Grip's AI would not have access to this information, making those preferencesimplicit(i.e. a preference the participant always had, but has not told us about).To identify implicit preferences Grip AI has tolearnwhat participants are interested in, using ‚Äòuser actions‚Äô. So, as a starting point, the Grip recommendation system combines theimplicit preferences it learnswith theexplicit preferences provided by participants.What data does Grip‚Äôs AI use?Grip‚Äôs AI uses a wide variety of data to make smart recommendations, including:Text (e.g. description data)User searchesInteractionsSimilar usersExplorationThis data, or to be more specific ‚Äòmetadata‚Äô, stores multiple facts about a participant, such as the answers to questions that you ask your attendees.The reason for using this plethora of data is to try and make thebestrecommendations given all the knowledge at that moment in time. As an event progresses, we gain more interaction data and a better understanding of each participant.Text (e.g. description data)Grip‚Äôs AI looks at free text data, such as headlines and summaries to make recommendations.¬† Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to better understand participants‚Äô preferences.User searchesThe searches a participant makes in the Grip platform are also used by the AI. Searching for participants is good way for participants to find people or products of interest. This data is used by our AI and it also increases interactions, resulting in better recommendations.InteractionsThe AI reviews participant interactions on the platform to learn attendees‚Äô preferences. Even a few minor interactions can help the AI a lot, thanks to the way it uses them.Therefore, it‚Äôs important to encourage attendees to interact with the platform as much as possible, particularly with answering recommendations (with a ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô),¬† manual matches or requesting meetings. This leads to improved recommendations for participants.Similar usersEven when we don‚Äôt have any interaction or preference data, we can use preferences from similar participants to understand what someone may be interested in.ExplorationWe also use algorithms to explore what interests participants have. This means some of our recommendations may not seem intuitive. However these are likely the AI trying different things to see if you may be more interested in those interests. This is a deliberate method to avoid the recommendations equivalent of ‚Äòfilter bubbles‚Äô (i.e. the AI learning a specific interest and not showing you people matching other valid interests of yours.)Custom Profile Fields are often used as part of this data, which you can learn more abouthere.Top tips:Best questions to ask:The ideal questions vary depending onType of event (e.g. networking, tradeshow etc)Demographics of exhibitors and attendeesIndustryThe best questions are those which reveal the reasons why your attendees want to meet others.¬† This requires you to identify the questions and answers that matter most. These are generally the best questions for the AI as well, since they can be used for matching and for learning.There are three types of questions our system uses:Supply and demand (e.g. what products do I supply vs what products am I interested in)Self-matching facts (e.g. topic of interest)Facts about individual or business (e.g. job role, industry or company size)Grip‚Äôs AI is most effective when all three types of questions are used, though it is far from necessary. However, it‚Äôs important to ensure the answers match exactly. For example, a supply answer (e.g. I provide recruitment services) needs to exactly match the demand answer (e.g. I want recruitment services).If the system doesn‚Äôt have the above information, it will learn over time based on the participants‚Äô interactions in the app. However, as it takes time, ideally the question types should be completed before the event. Assuming the questions are answered reasonably honestly, this gives the AI a better starting point.It‚Äôs worth noting that matchmaking performance is doubled (on average) by ensuring both a ‚Äòsupply/demand‚Äô question AND a ‚Äòfact-based‚Äô question¬† are included (either self-matching fact or fact about individual or business). To ensure event organisers provide their participants with a great participant experience, where they‚Äôre not spending time completing endless questions, participants can be asked different questions, based on their profiles.Best practices on numbers of questions/answers:The solution to the problem of having too much data is to limit your questions/answers, if possible. Of course, the ideal amount varies, depending on a number of factors, includingIndustrySpecialismQuestion class (fact, matching fact, supply and demand)We typically find around 5 questions with 5-10 answers being a good rule of thumb.With matching-fact or supply and demand questions, because of the advantage provided by matching them, you can potentially add a few more questions & answers to get to the ideal number - perhaps up to 10 questions.It‚Äôs important to use as much industry knowledge in their construction as possible, however sometimes organisers can get lost in the details - rather than seeing where they can simplify.Another good practice we sometimes use when there are too many answers to a specific question is to see if we can split the question and answers into multiple question/answer pairs (typically 2).Example of bad question/answer set:Original question:What do you want from this event?Original answers:event matchmaking, registration providers, analytics, badge scanning, wi-fi providers, hybrid event-tech, entertainment companies, caterers, bouncers, venues, advertisers, marketers, banner makers, print servicesExample of good question/answer set:Question 1:What event technologies are you interested in?Answers:event matchmaking, registration providers, analytics, badge scanning, wi-fil, hybrid event-techQuestion 2:What event services are you interested in?Answers:entertainment companies, caterers, bouncers, venues, advertisers, marketers, banner makers, print servicesAnswers to avoid:A common answer type which doesn‚Äôt help Grip‚Äôs AI is ‚Äòall of the above‚Äô. There are a few reasons this is not helpful, such asDifficulties in parsing the answer (there can be many ways of phrasing ‚Äòall of the above‚Äô).It is not actually informative as all answers are selectedIt is too easy to select (participants tend to select it because they are ‚Äònot not interested‚Äô in a value - rather than highlight the subset they are really interested in)We recommend against answers like this, and prefer participants to select all from a list, if needed.¬† Using ‚Äòall of the above‚Äô answers encourages participants to use it, rather than providing specific answers.The converse of ‚Äòall of the above‚Äô is ‚Äòother‚Äô. This type of answer is slightly more useful, but is still not an answer that should be encouraged. Where possible answers should include options to broadly cover all possibilities without resorting to the equivalent of ‚Äòother‚Äô, potentially by making some answers more broad than specific.We hope this article has been helpful for you. If you have any additional questions about AI, recommendations or machine learning through the Grip platform, our data scientists will be happy to help.

These Data Processing Terms supplement and are part of the Agreement.Defined terms used in the AgreementCapitalised terms not otherwise defined in these Data Processing Terms shall have the meaning given to them in the Agreement. Except as modified below, the terms of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.Except where the context requires otherwise, references in these Data Processing Terms to the Agreement are to the Agreement as amended by, and including, these Data Processing Terms.1.1To the extent that Intros shall process Guest Personal Data as Data Processor of the Customer, it shall do so in compliance with the obligations placed on it under Data Protection Laws and the terms of the Agreement.1.2The Customer shall at all times comply with all Data Protection Laws in connection with the processing of Guest Personal Data. The Customer shall ensure all instructions given by it to Intros in respect of Guest Personal Data (including the terms of this Agreement) shall at all times be in accordance with Data Protection Laws. The Customer shall indemnify and keep indemnified Intros against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fines, sanctions, interest, penalties, costs, charges, expenses, compensation paid to Data Subjects, demands and legal and other professional costs arising out of or in connection with any breach by the Customer of its obligations under these Data Processing Terms.1.3Intros shall:(a) only process the Guest Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement (and not otherwise unless alternative processing instructions are agreed between the parties in writing) except where otherwise required by applicable law (and shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless applicable law prevents it doing so on important grounds of public interest); and(b) if Intros believes that any instruction received by it from the Customer is likely to infringe the Data Protection Laws, promptly inform the Customer and be entitled to cease to provide the relevant Services until the parties have agreed appropriate amended instructions which are not infringing.1.4Taking into account the state of technical development and the nature of processing, Intros shall implement and maintain the technical and organisational measures set out in Security Summary Document to protect the Guest Personal Data against accidental, unauthorised or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or access.1.5Intros shall inform the Customer of any addition, replacement or other changes of third parties authorised by Intros to have logical access to and process Guest Personal Data in order to provide parts of the Services (‚ÄúSub-processors‚Äù) and provide the Customer with the opportunity to reasonably object to such changes on legitimate grounds. The Customer acknowledges that these Sub-processors are essential to provide the Services and that objecting to the use of a Sub-processor may prevent Intros from offering the Services to the Customer. Intros will enter into a written agreement with the Sub-processor imposing on the Sub-processor obligations comparable to those imposed on Intros under this Agreement, including appropriate data security measures. In case the Sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement with Intros, Intros will remain liable towards the Customer for the performance of the Sub-processor‚Äôs obligations under such agreement.

If Intros transfers Guest Personal Data to a jurisdiction for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Intros will ensure that appropriate safeguards have been implemented for the transfer of Guest Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws.1.8Intros shall, in accordance with Data Protection Laws, make available to the Customer such information that is in its possession or control as is necessary to demonstrate Intros' compliance with the obligations placed on it under this clause 1 and to demonstrate compliance with the obligations on each party imposed by Article 28 of the GDPR (and under any equivalent Data Protection Laws equivalent to that Article 28), and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, by the Customer (or another auditor mandated by the Customer) for this purpose (subject to a maximum of one audit request in any 12 month period).1.9Intros shall notify the Customer without undue delay and in writing on becoming aware of any security breach in respect of any Guest Personal Data.1.10On the end of the provision of the Services relating to the processing of Guest Personal Data, at the Customer‚Äôs cost and the Customer‚Äôs option, Intros shall either return all of the Guest Personal Data to the Customer or securely dispose of the Guest Personal Data (and thereafter promptly delete all existing copies of it) except to the extent that any applicable law requires Intros to store such Guest Personal Data. This clause 1 shall survive termination or expiry of this Agreement.1.11The Customer shall ensure that: Guests are provided with appropriate information regarding the processing of their Guest Personal Data, including by means of offering a transparent and easily accessible public privacy notice.1.12Processing of the Guest Personal Data by Intros under this Agreement shall be as set out below.(a) Subject-matter of processing: Processing Guest Data(b) Duration of Processing: For the duration of the provision of the Guest App Services.(c) Nature and purpose of the processing: providing Guests with access to and use of the Grip mobile application and the services available on it; sending messages to Guests on behalf of the Customer, regarding the operation of the Services.(d) Type of Personal Data: Email address; name; details of job role and position; demographic data; event being attended.(e) Categories of Data Subjects: Guests

Content:
How to Use Badge Scanning - Lead Generation Tool for Your EventBadge Scanning is a powerful feature that allows participants to easily connect with each other by scanning the QR Code of another participant through the mobile app. It‚Äôs also an effective lead generation tool for exhibitors and sponsors.Table of ContentsWhat is Badge Scanning?How to Configure Badge Scanning for Your EventStep 1: Enable Badge Scanning (For Grip Delivery Manager)Step 2: Add Unique Scan IDs to Participant ProfilesStep 3: Set Data Type PermissionsHow Badge Scanning Enhances Your EventBarcode LimitationsUsing Client-Provided QR CodesHow Badge Scanning Works for Event ParticipantsUsing Badge Scanning for Product ProfilesSuccessful Events that Used Badge ScanningFAQsWhat is Badge Scanning?Badge Scanning allows event participants to scan the QR Code of another participant using the event's mobile app, instantly creating a connection. After scanning, participants can:View the connection's profile and informationTrack who they‚Äôve scanned and who has scanned themAll of this information is accessible within the mobile app under the"More"section, which includes:QR / Badge ScannerMy Scan ListMy Scanned By ListMy QR CodeHow to Configure Badge Scanning for Your EventFollow these steps to enable and configureBadge Scanningfor your event on the Grip platform.Step 1: Enable Badge Scanning (For Grip Delivery Manager)Badge scanning is activated at the event level through theGrip Dashboard. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:Steps to Enable Badge Scanning:Access App Settings (For Grip Delivery Manager)In the Grip Dashboard, go toApp Settings>App Configuration & Special Actions.UnderAdmin Event Configuration, toggle onBadge Scanning.Enable Partial Badge ScanningTo enablePartial Badge Scanning, go toApp Settings>App Management>Feature Control.TogglePartial Badge Scanningon.This option is typically used with events that utilize Experient badges, as their scan IDs are dynamic.Note on Partial Badge Scanning:Partial Badge Scanning allows a successful scan by matching only the first few characters of the Scan ID, instead of the entire Scan ID. This is specifically designed for the Experient badge format, where the scan IDs are dynamic and unpredictable. There is no control over how many characters need to match; it‚Äôs optimized for Experient badges.When Partial Badge Scanning is enabled, Scan IDs must be at least 10 characters long.When Partial Badge Scanning is disabled, Scan IDs can be under 10 characters.Step 2: Add Unique Scan IDs to Participant ProfilesOnce Badge Scanning is enabled for the event, you‚Äôll need to assign aunique Scan IDto each participant‚Äôs profile in theScan IDfield. This allows the system to generate a corresponding QR code for each event participant.Important:Unlike other fields on a profile in Grip, Scan IDs are automatically deleted (overwritten with null) if no value is provided during a profile update via integration or bulk spreadsheet upload.Additionally, once a Scan ID is added to a profile, the "My QR Code" button will always appear in the "More" menu of the mobile app, even if Badge Scanning is turned off or unavailable for that data type.Step 3: Set Data Type PermissionsBefore Badge Scanning can be fully functional, you need to configure whichdata typesare permitted to scan the badges of other data types. To do this:Go toEvent Details>Event Data Types>Settings>Type Permissions.Select whichData Typecan scan the badges of other data types.Once the Scan IDs have been assigned and permissions set, be sure to test the Badge Scanning feature on the mobile app to ensure everything is functioning properly.How Badge Scanning Enhances Your EventBadge Scanning is an excellentLead Generation Toolfor exhibitors and sponsors. It allows them to easily collect and track leads. Exhibitors with access to theMy Teamfeature can view all leads on aLead Overview Page. Leads are generated through:Badge ScanningConnectionsCompany/Product Page ViewsMeetingsExhibitors can export leads at the end of the event and see details like:Name, Job Title, Company Name (if provided)Lead Source (e.g., badge scan, connection)Contacts Details (if provided)For more details, visitGrip Teams Exports.Barcode LimitationsMake sure to adhere to the following character limits for barcodes:1D barcodes: Maximum 85 characters.2D barcodes: Maximum 128 characters.Using Client-Provided QR CodesIf the client is using their own QR Codes, ensure the following:Confirm that the QR provider supports one of the following barcode types:1D barcodes: EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E, Code-39, Code-93, Code-128, ITF.2D barcodes: QRCode, Data Matrix, PDF-417, AZTEC.Ensure that theScan IDentered in Grip matches the value encoded in the QR Code.Important:¬†Some barcode formats allow specific special characters. For example, the Code-39 format supports-,.,$,/,+,%, and spaces. However, characters with accents (e.g., √®, √´, √∂, √≠, √∫) arenotsupported in ScanIDs at Grip. Always test ScanIDs you are unsure about before the event begins.How Badge Scanning Works for Event ParticipantsBadge Scanning makes it easy for event participants to connect. If a participant meets someone they want to connect with, they can simply scan their badge using the mobile app, creating an instant connection and allowing them to view the person's profile in the app.Using Badge Scanning for Product ProfilesBadge Scanning isn‚Äôt limited to event participants‚Äîit can also be used forProduct Profiles. Here‚Äôs how it works:Assign a uniqueScan IDto each product in the Grip platform.Use a QR Code generator to create QR Codes for each product.Print and attach the QR Codes to physical products at the event.When event participants scan a product‚Äôs QR Code, they can access the product‚Äôs profile and additional information. This action turns the event participants into a lead for the exhibitor, enabling more effective lead tracking.Highly Successful Events that Used Badge ScanningFOCUSFOCUS was an in-person event that used Badge Scanning to generate both connections and exhibitor leads. Out of the 3,304 total connections at the event, 1,814 (54%) came from Badge Scanning.Texworld Apparel Home SourcingTexworld Apparel Home Sourcing, a hybrid event, used Badge Scanning for product showcases. Attendees could scan QR Codes on physical fabric samples to get more information. By the end of the event, there were 33,443 product scans.FAQsQ: Can I rename the Badge Scanning section on the mobile app?A:Currently, the Badge Scanning section is hard-coded for all Grip events, so it cannot be customized. However, our product team is planning to address this in a future update.Q: What happens if the Scan ID doesn't match?A:If the Scan ID entered in Grip doesn‚Äôt match the value encoded in the QR Code, the scan will fail. Ensure that the Scan ID and QR Code value are identical.Q: Can ScanIDs contain special characters?A:Certain special characters can be used, depending on the barcode type. For example, the Code-39 format allows for-,.,$,/,+,%, and spaces. However, characters with accents (like √®, √´, √∂, √≠, √∫) arenotsupported in ScanIDs. Be sure to test any ScanIDs you're unsure about before the event.Q: Can I track how many times an event participant's badge has been scanned?A:Yes, attendees can track who has scanned them via theMy Scanned By Listin the mobile app.Q: Is Badge Scanning available for both iOS and Android devices?A:Yes, Badge Scanning is available and works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices.Q: Why do I still see 'My QR Code' in the mobile app even though Badge Scanning hasn't been enabled for this event?A:If a Scan ID has been added to a participant's profile in theScan IDfield, the'My QR Code'section will still appear in the mobile app, even if Badge Scanning has not been officially enabled for the event.Q: Are badge scan IDs, registration IDs, and email scans case-sensitive? If I have two identical ones but one is capitalized, will they be treated as separate?A:No, badge scan IDs, registration IDs, and email scans are case-insensitive. This means that if two IDs are the same but differ only in capitalization, they will be treated as identical and not recognized as separate scans or profiles.Q: Can Grip be used for Access Control onsite at an event?A:No, Grip‚Äôs Session Check-in functionality is not designed or suitable for onsite Access Control. Key reasons include:Onsite registrants would expect access within seconds of printing their badge, but since Grip does not handle badge printing, it would be impractical for Grip to update records quickly enough for venue entry.The reporting tools in Grip for session check-ins are not intended for access control management.If there‚Äôs poor or no Wi-Fi onsite, Grip‚Äôs badge scanning stores data locally and syncs when the internet is restored. This means there‚Äôs a risk of unauthorized entry using fake badges if real-time scanning isn‚Äôt possible.

URL: https://support.grip.events/field-explainer-text-for-custom-profile-fields

Content:
Field Explainer Text For Custom Profile FieldsExplainer text for Custom Profile Fields allows you to add contextual information to your Custom Profile Field. This appears in one of two places depending on the type of Custom Profile Field you are creating.For a freeform Custom Profile Field, this text appears within the text input box to give direction to the person inputting the information about what information they should be inputting. For example, if they are asking for a job title, the explainer text could be ‚ÄòAdd your job title here‚Äô.For a pre-defined Custom Profile Field, this text appears at the top of the selector modal to give direction to the person inputting the information about what information they should be inputting. For example, if you are selecting a job seniority, the explainer text could be ‚ÄòSelect the seniority of your job‚Äô.These are used to give additional contextual information to somebody who is inputting information during onboarding or whilst they are editing their profile. It allows you to specify the information you want, in order to avoid confusion or to give additional guidance on what is required.How to set them upThis is a very simple process. When you are creating a Custom Profile Field, simply add your explainer text to the ‚ÄòField Explainer Text‚Äô field. This will then appear either in the text input (for freeform fields) or at the top of the modal (for pre-defined fields). Examples below.Front end example.FAQsCan I add multiple languages?Yes, you just need to add the different languages by clicking on the flag beside the field and selecting the flag for the language you would like to add or edit.Is there a character limit?Yes, for freeform fields this is currently set at 85 characters and for pre-defined fields this is set as 173 characters. The reason for these character limits is to prevent issues with text overlapping the end of fields.

Title: Minimum, Maximum, and Required Custom Profile Fields

URL: https://support.grip.events/minimum-maximum-and-required-custom-profile-fields

Content:
Minimum, Maximum, and Required Custom Profile FieldsThese give you the ability to set the maximum and/or minimum number of answers required for a Custom Profile Field. Required is simply the requirement for a field that can only have a single answer to have one answer.There are a number of uses for these, whether it is to make sure that essential information is collected from those attending your event, whether it is to make sure that matchmaking is as powerful as possible, or to limit the number of answers for specific questions.It is worth noting that required fields are mandatory for attendees to complete before they can access the event on Grip, Companies and Items will be required to complete the required fields before they can make any amendments to their profiles. Maximum, minimum, and required fields are always created at Field level. This ensures that any Data Type that has the field assigned to them will be subject to the same requirements. The only time this won‚Äôt be the case is if the profile is also subject to a monetization limit for the same field.We highly recommend viewing our overview of Custom Profile Fieldsarticle herebefore proceeding as we will assume you know what Custom Profile Fields are and how to set them up.In this article, we will cover:Creating Maximum, and Minimum value limitsCreating a Required filedFAQsCreating Maximum, and Minimum value limits1. Create a Custom Profile Field with the ‚ÄòInput Type‚Äô field set to either ‚ÄòPre-Defined Only‚Äô or ‚ÄòFreeform and Pre-Defined‚Äô and the ‚ÄòHow many answers can be selected?‚Äô field set to ‚ÄòCan Pick Many‚Äô.2. After the maximum, and minimum value limit fields appear enter the maximum number of values allowed and the minimum number of values allowed.3.

Input any other configurations and values required and click saveFAQsWhat happens if I have a monetisation value that is different from the maximum set on the field?The monetisation value will override the maximum value set in the field.How is a Participant prevented from accessing the event if they have not completed the required fields?Participants must complete onboarding in order to access the event, if there is a required field or a field with minimum values that has not been completed then they cannot move past onboarding.Can I have a field with both maximum and minimum values?Yes, you can have fields that have both a maximum and minimum number. If you set both as the same value, you are defining the exact number you will receive.

Title: How to Use the 'Link' Custom Field?

URL: https://support.grip.events/custom-profile-field-links

Content:
How to Use the 'Link' Custom Field?Custom Field Links allow event participants to add links to their profiles in a clean and professional manner. Instead of displaying the full URL, the links will have a title and description, making the page look more polished.This article explains how to set up and manage Link Custom Fields in your event.Before proceeding, we recommend reading ourCustom Field overview articlefor a general understanding of custom fields.In this article, you will learn:How to Set Up Link Custom FieldsOnboarding & Profile EditingVia Native and Managed IntegrationsVia Spreadsheet Upload (for Profiles)FAQsHow to Set Up Link Custom FieldsLinks are a type of Custom Field. To add them, select‚ÄòLink‚Äôfrom the input type on the Custom Field creation page. You can optionally set the minimum and maximum number of links allowed, which will apply to event participants after they log in. These limits do not apply to event organizers.There are a few ways to add data to 'Link' custom field:1. Manually via Grip Dashboard (For Event Organisers)Event organisers can manually add links to a 'Link' custom field, just like any other custom field. Simply go to the Grip Dashboard, select the relevant data type and profile, and input the link details.2. Via Native and Managed Integrations (For Event Organisers)Event organisers using Native Integrations can map multiple source links to a single 'Link' custom field during the data import process. Each link can include an optional title and description to keep URLs organised.For more details, check out our article onHow to Use Native Integrations.3. Via Spreadsheet Upload (for Profiles) -¬†(For Event Organisers)When uploading data via a spreadsheet, columns for each custom field, including 'Link' custom fields, will be visible. Event Organiser can add multiple URLs in a single cell by separating them with a designated symbol.Note: Titles and descriptions cannot be added via spreadsheets, but participants can log in and add these details after the URLs are uploaded.For more details, see our article onSpreadsheet Uploads.4. Onboarding & Profile Editing (For Event Participants)Event participants can add links during onboarding or later when editing their profiles. Links will be displayed in a block, where participants can assign each a title, description, and destination URL. If a participant sets a link in only one language, the system will automatically apply that information to all other available languages.Participants can add links via the'Edit Profile'page, while companies can do so through the 'My Team'portal.Warning: Event participants cannot currently edit their custom link fields through the mobile app. To make changes, they must log in via the web platform. Any updates made will be visible to all other event participants. However, participants will not be able to see their own custom links within the app, but these links will still be visible to others.FAQsQ: How many Link Fields can I add?A:You can add as many Link Custom Fields as needed. However, we recommend minimizing the number of fields since each can contain unlimited URLs. For example, you might create one field for brochures, another for product links, and another for social media.Q: How do I add links through an integration?A:In Native Integrations, go to the data mapping screen where you can import multiple URLs into one or more Link Fields. For detailed instructions, refer to ourHow to Use Native Integrations article.Q: How does it work with multiple languages?A:Links can be added in multiple languages supported by the event. However, the link must first be added in the default event language. If no other languages are entered, the title, description, and URL will default to the event's main language. You can edit these fields in any supported language as needed.

How to use and configure custom fields for data profile on Grip dashboardThis article explains how event organisers can use Custom Fields in the Grip Dashboard to structure participant and session data. Custom Fields improve filtering, power AI recommendations, and help attendees discover relevant people and content.This article is forevent organisers managing events on the Grip Dashboard.Custom fields allow organisers to collect, display and structure key data about participants, companies, sessions and more. These fields support onboarding, enhance search and filtering, and improve AI-based recommendations for networking and content discovery.There are two key types of custom fields:Profile custom fields‚Äì for people, companies, or itemsSession custom fields‚Äì for agenda sessions and activities. For more info on session custom fields seethis article.You can use custom fields to:Display structured information on profiles or sessionsCollect extra data from participants during onboardingPower Grip's Al recommendation engineEnable advanced filters and improve search relevanceImportant:Avoid using Custom Fields to store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unless you have explicit consent and proper security controls in place.In this article we will cover:Types of custom fieldsPermission levels for profile custom fieldsManaging Custom Profile Fields within a Single EventUnderstanding the Custom Profile Fields PageHow to create a Single-Event Custom Profile FieldManaging and creating Multi-Event Custom Profile FieldsHiding and Displaying valuesImporting Data into Custom Profile FieldsFAQsTypes of custom fieldsThere are two levels of custom fields:1.

You can filter or sort by:Status in Event‚Äì Whether a field is active or inactive.Field Type‚Äì Identifies whether the field is a Single-Event or Multi-Event field.Input Type‚Äì The format of the field, such as dropdown, text input, or link.Matching Type‚Äì Indicates how the field is used in Grip‚Äôs AI recommendation engine.Types Using Field in Event‚Äì Lists the data types (e.g. Attendee, Exhibitor) assigned to this field.Settings‚Äì Opens the configuration panel for that specific field.From this page, you can:Activate or deactivate fields within the event.Assign fields to one or more data types.Edit settings for single-event custom fields.Create new custom fields for single event.Note:You do not need App Admin permissions to create or editSingle-Event Custom Fields.However,App Admin access is requiredto create or modifyMulti-Event Custom Fields, as changes may affect multiple events across the app.Creating a single-event custom profile fieldTo create a new Profile Custom Field:Go toEvent Details > Custom Fields (Profiles tab)ClickCreate New Custom Profile FieldChoose whether it‚Äôs aSingle-EventorMulti-Eventfield(Only App Admins can create Multi-Event fields)Required Step: Declare PII UsageBefore creating the field, you‚Äôll need to declare whether it will storePersonally Identifiable Information (PII).Do not use Custom Fields to store sensitive data(like email, phone number, or birthdate) unless absolutely necessary and legally compliant.Changing settings for a single data type onlyOnce custom fields have been created to customise field settings per data type:Go toEvent Details > Event Data Types > [Select Data Type] > Custom Fields,orGo toData > [Data Type] > Custom Profile FieldsHere, you can:Toggle visibility or editability for a specific data typeReorder fields as they appear in profilesTroubleshoot if changes are not reflected (contact your Grip representative ‚Äî caching may be involved)To make changes on a data type-level only, you can access Custom Profile Field settings by going into the individual data type that they're assigned to, via two routes:Go to Event Details > Event Data Types > Choose a data type > Custom FieldsGo to Data > Choose a data type > (in the example below we've usedAttendee).Once the list of Attendee profiles has loaded, clickCustom Profile Fieldsat the top.You will then be taken to the Custom Profile Fields page specifically for this data type. You can go back to theevent-levelpage by clicking the button 'Go to event custom profile fields'.On this page you're looking at controls for any custom fields that are assigned to this data type - changing settings herewill not affectother data types, even when they're sharing a field.This is very useful if you have field that you don't want visible for a particular data type - simply head to this page, find the field and toggle off that option. If the option is disabled and you can't use it, that's a sign that it's being blocked by the same setting higher up the permission level. You'll need to make sure you've enabled this permission for that field at the single or multi-event settings first.You can also re-order visible fields from this page, by dragging them up or down. This will affect the order in which they're displayed on a profile from the current data type. Note that Link-type fields are always shown underneath all other fields.If you've previously viewed a profile within an event, re-ordered the profile fields, and then notice that the order of the fields has not changed, speak to your Grip contact for assistance. Profile information is usually 'cached' when you view it, meaning that we may need to force a regeneration of the profile's data to see any updates.How to create a Single-Event Custom FieldTips for creating effective Custom FieldsWhen it comes to custom fields, we believe in giving you the flexibility to add as many characters as you need. However, we'd like to highlight the importance of testing the visual impact of longer field names. Opting for a shorter, concise version can enhance the overall look and readability of your fields.Additionally, we recommend using statements instead of questions for custom fields. This choice ensures full understanding when using them as filter options that your participants can use. By following these recommendations, you can optimize the feel and functionality of your custom fields.Remember, our goal is to provide you with the best user experience possible, so feel free to explore the possibilities while keeping these suggestions in mind.Again, the steps below are specific to Profile custom fields - Session custom fields are created from the second tab and have fewer options.See our companion article here.1.Click the 'Create new custom profile field' button on the 'Custom Profile Fields' tab.If you are an App Admin or above, you will be prompted about whether you want to create a multi-event field, or just a single-event field. Again, multi-event fields are recommended unless you don't plan on using this field again in future events.2.You will then land on the custom field creation page.Storing Personally Identifiable InformationInitially, you will be forced to answer the question of whether you plan to store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within the field that you're about to create. This is an extremely important question which we must get confirmation of before you can continue.PII is generally classed as 'any information that could be used by itself or in combination with other data to identify an individual'.For more information see here. In relation to the events industry, making data like people's names visible is generally unavoidable, so in reality this will be something like an email address, telephone number, date of birth, address etc.In general, the only information we recommend you store in custom fields should be interest or non-personal - for example, Company Details, Topics that the participant is interested in, website links etc.We strongly recommend that you do not store PII in custom fields, so as to avoid any issues with sensitive information being visible to participants in your event and risking GDPR or other data leak issues. If you do plan on storing PII in a custom field, answerYesand accept the prompt - and ensure that you have all the legal agreements from your participants in place to justify this decision, and protect you from legal repercussions.Additionally, if you plan to store PII in a custom field, we recommend that this field is set to not be visible (toggle off the 'Visible' control), for all of the same reasons as stated above.Field settingsOnce you've made your choice about PII data, you can continue with the field setup. First you'll need to select theInput typeof the field, so that we can show you the right options.Input type1. Pre-defined values:Create a field where answers can only be picked from a defined list, e.g. 'Industry'.For predefined input types, you can add the field's values in the 'Field Values' tab at the top of the page.2. Freeform:allows anything short line of text to be input, e.g. 'Name'. Freeform text cannot be used for recommendations.3. Pre-defined values and freeform inputallows a combination of the first two options.4. Link:Creates a multi-purpose link field to allow participants to create and manage multiple external weblinks on their profiles. Participants can add names and descriptions to their links themselves. This is really useful for allowing people to add Social Media links to their personal or company profiles and to avoid you having to create individual fields specific for each link.5. Marketing Consent:This uncommon field type allows your participants to specifically choose whether they want to share their information with a given company profile in your event, and prevents things like Leads in that company's Team from being populated unless the option is accepted.This will negatively affect engagement at your event, so we would recommend that you discuss this with a contact at Grip before using it.Once this initial choice is complete, you'll see the page add or remove options and you can continue with the remaining steps. If an option is disabled, that means it can't be used with theInput typeyou've selected.Field system name(only shown after field is created)Automatically-generated name, used as a unique ID for data integrations. This will stay the same regardless of name changes. It's not visible to participants.Profile field labelThis is the name of the field as it will appear within the event, click the flag to add different translations.Field Explainer TextThis customizable text appears as a placeholder in free-form input fields, or on the selection box for pre-defined and Link fields. Use it to give your attendees a hint about what the field's purpose is.Profile field visible.Controls whether this field and its contents can be shown on participant profiles in events.Profile field editable.Controls whether this field and its contents are editable by participants during onboarding or when editing their profiles.Profile field filterable.Controls whether this field and its contents are permitted as a filter on profile lists within events.Profile field can be used in recommendation engine.This should normally be turned on unless you specifically don't want to use the data in this field to help recommend this profile.Profile field can be used in personalized URLsControls whether the data in this field can be used as part of a personalized URL -see this article.Parent / Child fieldEnables parent/child functionality for this field -see this article.How many answers can be selected?Choose whether this field is a single or multiple choice field.After making a selection, you'll see aRequired fieldtoggle appear, or some options to control the minimum/maximum answers possible - more on this in the section below this table.Use for matchmaking engine as:This field gives you a choice about how our AI should interpret the data within this field.1.Fact- Facts are values used by our AI for learning purposes and in order to do things like compare 'similar' attendees. Use this option for general data about a user themselves - when any of the other more intent-based options below don't seem to fit.2.Supply- Used as a pair along with a demand field, to create a common ground between two data types. One group of people will select 'supply' values - for example an Exhibitor listing their available services.Once you've created a Supply field, you should connect it to its matching Demand field (if you're already created it of course).These values MUST exactly match those in the equivalent Demand field.3.Demand- The other group of people will select 'demand' values - as per the example above, this could be attendees showing interest those exhibitor services.Once you've created a Demand field, you should connect it to its matching Supply field (if you're already created it of course).These values MUST exactly match those in the equivalent Supply field.4.Matching fact- Matching Facts act as both Supply & Demand and are used to create matches using only one field. The AI is more likely to recommend users that have entered the same value(s) for the Matching Fact that they have both answered. If you want to ask more than one data type the exact same question, and want them all to be recommended to each other based on matching responses, this is easier than creating pairs of supply/demand fields.5.Unused- Use this if your data cannot or should not be used for AI recommendations - e.g. for web links.Types using field in eventThese are the types where you want this custom profile field to be present, e.g. Company, and Exhibitor representative.3.In the 'How many answers can be selected?' field, if you select 'Can pick one' you will see a required field toggle, which will make this Custom Profile Field mandatory to complete before proceeding in the platform. If you select 'Can pick many', you will see a minimum answers required box, and a maximum answers required box.We have an article which explains these options here.4.Click 'Create custom profile field' to confirm and create it.5.If you've created a pre-defined field, you'll be taken to the next tab in order to input the values (answers) that will form a list for your participants to select from.From here you can add your pre-defined answers. Click 'Add rows' and enter your answers. You can copy and paste values from a spreadsheet into these rows. You can paste as many values as you would like without needing to add new rows, simply copy and paste! You can delete rows by clicking the trash button under 'Delete'.Always clickSave new valuesbefore trying to leave the page.If a participant has already provided answers to questions and selected values in a Multi-Event Custom Field, such as during Event A, they won't need to fill them in again when attending Event B. The Custom Field data, including values and answers, will already be present, saving time and ensuring all information is pre-filled for a seamless experience. This means they will get even better recommendations with our AI learning more each time.Hiding and Displaying values (pre-defined fields only)When you create or import values you'll notice that each has a tag to indicate whether it is 'displayed' or 'hidden'. This effectively controls whether that value is visible to participants within your events and, if the field is being used for recommendations, allows the AI to use the displayed values. (Of course, if you've hidden the entirefieldby toggling off its visibility toggle, then no event participant will be able to see any data contained within it.)When you add values via the dashboard, they will be displayed by default.To Hide/Display a value, select the value(s) you want to deactivate and click ‚Äòhide selected‚Äô or 'display selected' at the top of the table.Where do Hidden values come from?Aside from values that you've specifically chosen to hide, hidden values will be values that were imported along with a profile, but didn't match any existing values for that field.See more on the section 'Importing Data into Custom Profile Fields' below.Managing and creating multi-event custom fieldsOnlyApp Adminscan manage these fields.To create or update:Navigate toApp Settings > Custom FieldsAlternatively, you can access this from Event Details > Custom Fields when managing a specific event, but full configuration must be done from App Settings.Clickcreate new multi-event fieldConfigure as needed (same as above in signle event custom field section)Configure the field using the same setup options described in the Single-event custom fields section.ClickSave changesNote: You cannot assign "Types Using Field by Default" during the initial creation of the field.Assigning default data typesTo apply the field across default data types (e.g., Attendee, Company, Exhibitor) for all events:InApp Settings > Custom Fields, find the field in the list.Click theSettings(cog icon) next to the field name.Scroll toTypes Using Field by Default.Select the appropriate data types from the dropdown.ClickSave Changes.Assigning types by default ensures the field will automatically appear in new and existing events where those types are used.Importing Data into Custom Profile FieldsSet up your fields and values before importing profile dataEnsure imported dataexactly matchespredefined valuesIncorrect spelling, spacing, or capitalisation will create hidden duplicatesHidden values won‚Äôt display or filter until manually reviewedIt's best to create and assign your Custom Profile Fields & values prior to importing participants, companies and items into your event. Doing so allows you to add data to these fields during data imports through dashboard bulk uploads and Native Integrations, as well as through custom API integrations.There are, however, two ways of importing the fields' values into these fields - through the dashboard (as explained further up in this article) or through simply importing profiles into your event.This is not relevant for freeform or link type fields, as their data is always populated by imported profiles - it cannot be pre-defined.Creating predefined values in advance (recommended)If you've populated all of the values for your fields in advance, you'll give your attendees a full list of options for those fields (for things like filtering lists and onboarding). This is the best option, as it ensures that all of the values that should be available to your attendees are indeed present.However,youmustensure that the profile data that is imported into your event EXACTLY matches the values you've entered into the dashboard.This is wherehiding and displaying valuesbecomes really important.Grip has some inbuilt logic that allows new values to be created automatically if they are present in a participant's profile when they're imported. This is very beneficial as it means that incoming data which is 'unexpected' (doesn't match values that already exist) is not lost. Instead, those values are 'hidden' and so not shown on profiles or filters.This logic helps prevent unwanted values from automatically appearing in your event and causing problems.Example:Your registration form contains a question with an option for the registrant to choose a valueorwrite their own response. This might be something like a 'Reasons for Attending' question, with some existing options, along with an 'Other: please specify' option.You don't know in advance what your registrants might write into that box, and whether it should be visible to everyone else.In Grip, you've added your existing options, so anything else that comes through as a value will be hidden automatically. This prevents unwanted answers from clogging up your filter options for this field, for example, leaving only the 'displayed' values that you initially set.This means of course that if the values that are coming in through an integration don't exactly match an existing value, they will be created and hidden, and you'll end up with answers that are very similar to each other. As mentioned above, this is why you must be very accurate when entering values in advance - spaces, symbols, spelling etc. must be precise otherwise your profiles' values will be hidden.If you notice blank profiles or filters missing values in your event, mismatched custom field values are likely to be the cause.You will also be able to check by finding a profile whose data isn't displaying, opening it in the dashboard and trying to save the profile. If the values assigned to it don't match what's been 'displayed' in that custom field's values, you'll see an error saying 'Not all Profile Field Data was updated', and the problem field(s) and value(s) will be highlighted:Note:Custom field valuescannot be editedonce created. If you need to make changes, you‚Äôll need todelete the existing value and add a new one.What can I do about it?The issue is that your data doesn't match - so you need to work out which is correct. Is the data you entered into the dashboard wrong, or are the profiles that are being registered coming in with incorrect data?If the values coming in look the same but are being created as 'duplicates' and are hidden, there is probably an issue like a leading or trailing space character, or even two symbols that look the same but are actually different.Once you've worked out where the problem values are coming from, you'll need to take some steps to 'clean-up' your data.If you entered values into the dashboard and the imported profile data is correct:Delete (or hide) incorrect values on the field's value page.Add all missing values and ensure they match the data coming in.Or, if your dashboard data is good, but the profiles being imported have incorrect values:Correct the problems in the integration or data upload so that the values match the dashboard.Delete the profiles that you've previously imported.Reimport the profiles with the corrected data.You should notice that values will start to appear in filters and on profiles and you should not see any errors when saving profiles in the dashboard.If you've previously viewed a profile with incorrect data in the event, have fixed it, and then see no new values (or the old values) still shown, speak to your Grip contact for assistance. Profile information is usually 'cached' when you view it, meaning that we may need to force a regeneration of the profile's data to see any updates. This does not include the dashboard, where profile information should always be shown correctly.Relying on data integrations to populate values (not recommended)If you skip predefining values:Grip will auto-create hidden values from unmatched importsYou must manually review and display them laterRisk: messy filters or blank profiles if data doesn‚Äôt match predefined valuesFAQsQ: Can I have multiple Custom Profile fields with the same name?A: Yes, you can have multiple Custom Profile fields with the same name.Q: How much Custom Profile Field data can be stored against one profile?A: The maximum size a profile's CPF data can be is 64kb. The character limit will depend on the data being sent but works out as roughly 25,000 characters per profile. This is a very large limit and profiles containing anywhere near this amount of data would be very difficult to manage and view in an event.Q: Can I copy and paste data values into the Grip dashboard from an external spreadsheet?A: Yes, edit the field, go to the 'values' page, click 'add rows' and then paste as many values as you like into an empty cell, like you would a spreadsheet.Q: Who can create Multi-Event Custom Profile Fields?A: Only app admins can create and edit Multi-Event Custom Profile Fields.Q: In what order do Custom Profile Fields appear in onboarding?A: Currently there is no hard rule, but they generally appear in the order in which they are created.Q: Event participants have reported that they can't update the custom URL profile field via the mobile app. Is that supposed to be the case?A:Yes, this is expected. The custom field link can only be added or updated via the Grip Dashboard or the web networking platform. While the link will appear on the profile, participants do not have the option to update it through the mobile app. Currently, creating or updating custom field links via mobile is not supported.Q: Event participants have reported that they can't see the custom URL on their profile in the mobile app. Is that supposed to be the case?A: Yes, this is a known limitation that we are planning to work on. However, participants should still be able to view custom field URLs when viewing other users' profiles.Q: Are emojis supported within custom profile fields?A: Yes, emojis are supported within custom profile fields and their values.Q: How can I export my Custom Profile Field values once they have been created?A: In order to export CPF values, select the Custom Profile Field first. Open the tab ‚ÄòSingle-Event Field Values‚Äô or ‚ÄòMulti-Event Field Values‚Äô, and click on the ‚ÄòExport Data‚Äô button.Q: Help! Field values seem to be missing or profiles are blank.A: It's likely that you have a data problem, and the incoming fields values don't match what's been Displayed for each field. See theHiding & Displaying valuesandImporting Datasections above.Q: Can I use different values for recommendations between supply & demand fields?A: No. Supply and Demand matching will only work if the values for related fields are an exact match. This means that their structure needs to be identical too.For example, you will not get recommendations for supply & demand fields that are related but where one side uses parent/child values and the other does not.Q: What are the default Profile Fields available globally on Grip?A: The following default Profile Fields are standard across Grip and always editable unless profile editing is disabled:NameHeadlineSummary(Most Recent) Job Title(Most Recent) CompanyLocationTo control whether these fields can be used as filters throughout the event platform,click here.Q: How can I customize which Profile Fields participants can edit on the event platform?A:Profile Editing Enabled: Participants can edit Custom Fields during onboarding and on the Edit Profile page. Fields with editing disabled will not appear in these sections.Profile Editing Disabled: No fields can be edited, and the onboarding step for profile editing is skipped.Q: What if theEmbedded Video URLfield is deleted or is not working properly?A: If theEmbedded Video URLfield already exists in your Grip Dashboard, you can simplyreactivate itand reuse it.But if the field has beendeletedor thedefault version isn‚Äôt working properly, follow these steps to recreate it:Create a new custom fieldand make sure theinitial name is exactlyEmbedded Video URL(this is important for the system to recognize and apply the correct embed behavior).After saving, you canchange the label shown to usersto anything you prefer ‚Äî it won‚Äôt affect the video embedding, as long as thesystem nameremainsEmbedded Video URL.Note: The system name is what enables video embeds to work correctly, not the visible field label.

Title: Parent/Child Custom Profile Fields

URL: https://support.grip.events/parent/child-custom-profile-fields

Content:
Parent/Child Custom Profile FieldsCreating sub-categories within Custom FieldsA Parent/Child Custom Profile Field is one that has at least two levels of categorization. They are incredibly useful for events where you have large datasets that need to be navigable. A good example of this in everyday life would be on retail sites where you have millions of products, each within their own categories.The primary use for a Parent/Child Custom Profile Field is to sort large datasets into a more navigable and usable format. It means that a dataset of 1000 values is no longer unmanageable as you can group data into logical categories.Parent/Child Custom Profile Fields are also a great way to gain very granular matches for those at your event given that a match at the top level shows a slight match, whilst a match at the third level is incredibly strong.Parent/Child Custom Profile Fields can be used for all Data Type categories within Grip, whether you want attendees to be able to better match for impactful meetings or whether you want to make sure that exhibitors are more easily discoverable.If you do not fully-understand Custom Profile Fields, we highly recommend reading ourCustom Profile Field articlebefore proceeding with Parent/Child Custom Profile Fields.You cannot currently see Parent/Child Custom Profile Fields during onboarding within the Mobile Apps (the fields will automatically be skipped).In this article, we will cover:How to setup a Parent/Child Custom Profile FieldHow to add a new Child to a Parent valueHow to change a level nameHow to hide valuesHow to display hidden valuesEvent platform exampleFAQsHow to setup a Parent/Child Custom Profile Field1. Click 'Create a new custom profile field'.2. Add the name of the field and select the 'Allow pre-defined values only' Input type. This is the only Input type that will show the Parent/Child toggle.3. Click the ‚ÄòParent/Child Field‚Äô toggle.4. Enter the other necessary settings, also outlined in our article regarding Custom Profile Fields. Click 'Create custom profile field' to save.5. Go back to the Custom Profile Field you have just created, and go to the values page. Click ‚Äòadd rows‚Äô to add the first/highest ‚Äòlevel‚Äô of values ie continents and give the level a name (this level name acts as the label that will appear on the event filters).6. Select a value that you would like to add as a parent and in the actions column for that value select ‚Äòadd child‚Äô.7. Give that ‚Äòlevel‚Äô a name ie Country (you only have to do this the first time you add a value to a new level of category).8. Add all values for that category.9. Repeat for all categories.*If you have over two levels of categorisation, follow the above for the third child level.10. Click 'Save new values'.How to add a new Child to a Parent value1. Select the parent value and click on the edit icon to the right of the table.*If this is adding a new level, give the level a name).2. Add the values required (we suggest having these present in a spreadsheet, then you can simply copy and paste them all in one go).3. Click 'Save new values'.How to change a level name1. Go to the row of a value that is on the correct level and click on the edit icon on the right side of the row.2. Click ‚ÄòEdit Level Name‚Äô.3. Enter new level name and click 'Save changes'.How to hide values1. Select the value(s) you want to deactivate and click ‚Äòhide selected‚Äô at the top of the table.*Note: If you hide a parent value, this will also hide all children for that parent value.How to display hidden values1. Select the value(s) you want to reactivate and click ‚Äòdisplay selected‚Äô at the top of the table.*Note: If you display a previously hidden parent value the children will remain hidden until reactivated themselves.Event platform example1. Here is a simple example of what a Parent/Child Custom Profile Field could look like in the onboarding screen within your event.2. Participants can filter by Parent/Child categories within native lists on mobile.FAQsHow many layers can I add?There is no limit to the number of layers you can add, however, it is worth noting that we don‚Äôt recommend going past three given that this can quickly causea usability and management challenges.Do all my selectable values need to be on the same level?No, a selectable value is one that does not have any children. For example, if you were to have ‚ÄòUK > London‚Äô and ‚ÄòUSA > California > San Francisco‚Äô in the same field, both London and San Francisco would be selectable as they have no children despite being on different levels.How much Custom Profile Field data can be stored against one profile?The maximum size a profile's CPF data can be is 64kb. The character limit will depend on the data being sent but works out as roughly 25,000 characters per profile. This is a very large limit and profiles containing anywhere near this amount of data would be very difficult to manage and view in an event.Do all of my values need to be unique?No, although values with the same parent must be unique. The reason for this is because there need to be duplicates in what we refer to as ‚Äòleaves‚Äô which are all selectable values. For instance, I could have ‚ÄòEurope > UK > Manchester‚Äô or ‚ÄòNorth America > USA > Manchester‚Äô - both ‚Äòleaves‚Äô are ‚ÄòManchester‚Äô but are entirely different places.Is there a limit to the number of values I can add?There is no limit to the number of values that can be added, however, both from a management and usability perspective we would suggest keeping the number below 5000.Is there a limit to the length of values I can input?There is not a set limit, but it is worth considering how these will appear on different screen sizes if you go over 50 characters for a single value.How are integrations impacted?This is a new feature and will not impact existing integrations. In order to add values to a parent/child field please use >> as a layer delineator. For instance if you had Europe as the top category, then UK, then London, this would be imported as "Europe>>UK>>London"What levels are taken into account for matching?At present matching is done for a full ‚Äòpath‚Äô for instance, if I select Europe>>UK>>London and somebody else selects Europe>>UK>>London then that would be a match, however if somebody else chose ‚ÄòEurope>>UK>>Birmingham‚Äô that would not be a match.Does there always need to be a child selected?You cannot currently select a parent category, you can only select the lowest value without children. It‚Äôs worth noting that this may be on different levels.How can I export my Custom Profile Field values once they have been created?In order to export predefined CPF values, select the Custom Profile Field, open the tab ‚ÄòSingle-Event Field Values‚Äô or ‚ÄòMulti-Event Field Values‚Äô, and click on the ‚ÄòExport Data‚Äô button. CSV & XLSX format files are available.

Content:
Meeting locations and inheritanceIn this article we‚Äôre going to look at default meeting locations and how participants and items can inherit a location from a company.We will cover:What location inheritance is and why you may want to use itHow to turn on location inheritanceHow to select a default locationWhat is location inheritance?Before exploring location inheritance, it‚Äôs important to understand how participants, items and companies can be assigned a booth. You can read aboutthis here.When a company has a booth assigned, it will appear on their profile. You can see in this example, Grip has had booth A01 assigned to it. Attendees therefore know that is the location Grip and its reps are at.In this example, Grip may have 20 representatives at the event. Assigning booth A01 to each of the representatives would be a time consuming process. Therefore you may choose to use the location inheritance feature, which will automatically assign all representatives the booth.How to turn on location inheritance1. This is enabled at the data type level on the participant data type settings page. Visit the settings page for the user data type you wish to inherit the company‚Äôs location. By going event data types > participants, then selecting the gear icon.2. Scroll to the relationships section at the bottom, toggling on ‚Äòinherit meeting location‚Äô for company type you wish this participant type to inherit the location from. In this example, we‚Äôre on the exhibitor representative‚Äôs data type settings page and have toggled ‚Äòinherit meeting location‚Äô on for the exhibitor - exhibitor representative relationship. This means any exhibitor representative profiles with a relationship with an exhibitor profile will inherit the exhibitor‚Äôs location.*It‚Äôs important to note, however, that participants will only inherit the location if inheritance was turned on BEFORE the location was assigned to the company.How to select a default location1. Select a company from the 'Data' section within the dashboard that you would like to assign/change the default location for.2. Click on the 'Settings' tab at the top of the page and scroll down to 'Assigned meeting locations'.¬† here you can select a location and select the default location for the company. Participants and products will then inherit the default location.

How do I set up a private app in Hubspot?Follow these detailed instructions outlined in the Hubspot developer documentshttps://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps .We recommend naming your private app to clearly indicate it will be the one used for Grip.2. Now that the private app is set up, the access token will be available for the superadmin users.¬† To find the access token, navigate to settings, Integrations, and private apps.3. On theAccesstokencard, clickShow tokento reveal your access token. ClickCopyto copy the token to your clipboard for use in Grip‚Äôs dashboard. You will not need the Client secret.Note: The same Access token will provide access for all Lists within the Hubspot account. For security, we recommend Rotating the access Token once an integration has stopped running in Grip.Connect HubspotThis section will provide steps on how to connect to Hubspot. This section assumes that you have already configured a Private App and API access on Hubspot and have access to the required credentials.When would I use this?These steps should be taken as your first step to configuring a Native Integration with Hubspot.How do I use this?1. Connect to Hubspot, there are two Hubspot blocks depending on that data that needs importing.ContactsAny lists that are set up, the contacts within will be available in this connector block.CompaniesCompany data may also be stored in Hubspot. This can be imported, however its important that if Company data is relavent for various event, that identifing fields are added in Hubspot.2. The next window you will need to add your access Token.3. Next you can select your source event that data should be imported from. You can use the¬† built in search functionality.A list of "events" will be available. These events are synonymous to lists in Hubspot. If you there are various lists associated to the event, additional integrations will need to be set up.4. Select Source data from Hubspot. Click the down arrow next to 'Select data type(s)'. The only option should be "Contacts".¬† Select which data type in Grip data should be imported too. If there are different "registration types" within the same lists, the filter step will be important to identify who to import into this Grip data type. SeeImportant Notesfor more information on filtering.Note: only one Grip data type can be selected, if additional types are needed, an additional integration should be set up.5. Under the section 'Only retrieve records that were created within the following period' (pointers), select one of the two options:'From the last time Grip successfully retrieved records' is the recommended option for integration that will be scheduled to run repeatedly. This will look for any new or updated records.'From start time to end time' is the recommended option if you are trying to run an update and want to make sure all records are updated. The recommended start time would be when registration opened and the recommended end time would be today.6. This has now connected the Hubspot to the Grip event, click next and move onto filtering and data mapping.Recommended next steps :Filter Data FeaturePointersHubspot CompaniesPointer type: Update time of the last recordPointer during preview (Filtering, Mapping, Preview): YesCheck on creation time or update time: Update time | Creation timeData type filtering: NoTime window filtering: Yes (start time only)Hubspot ContactPointer type: Last imported timePointer during preview (Filtering, Mapping, Preview): NoCheck on creation time or update time: Update time | Creation time (compare locally)Data type filtering: NoTime window filtering: No (we fetch all the contacts first and filter locally)Important NotesYou may need to run Hubspot integrations many times in a row to get all available registrations. This is because:Hubspot does not support data type filtering so Grip must process all available records in a List, which can be slow.Hubspot limits every integration run to retrieving only 1000 records at a time, many of which will not be the correct data type.If you don‚Äôt see as many registrations as you expect, keep running the integration on repeat, even if Grip shows that 0 records are being imported each time.‚Äù

How do I use Native Integrations?The Native Integration feature allows you to integrate Grip with a variety of event ticketing or event registration data systems.
Native Integrations automates data importing, formatting and synchronisation between your data sources and Grip.Welcome to Grip‚Äôs Native Integration guide. The guide will explain the various steps required to set-up a native integration within Grip.This guide is broken down into multiple sections to align with the various pages you will use when configuring your native integration.Each section highlights:Which data source it applies toIf the step is optional or requiredExamples of how to use the feature, where applicableIf you are unfamiliar with Native Integrations, we suggest reviewing each section in turn.Recommended next section:If you already have the API credentials and have successfully connected to the source event within the dashboard (including selecting the types to map), we recommend starting at theSelect the source data step, where you can select more than one source data to be imported into your single Grip data type, as well as set up the record retrieval start time and intervals.If you are unsure where to get your API credentials from,¬† want to know more about connecting to your event in the Native Integration Wizard, we recommend looking an one of the articles below. Depending on which source you are using, it will differ.Source ArticlesSwoogoCventVisitHubspotASPA2ZCDSMaritz/ ExperientBizzaboTitoOther contents:Select Source Data featureFilter Data feature (optional)Map Data feature (required)Modifier: Capitalize the first letter (optional)Modifier: Cut and take a portion (optional)Modifier: Replace (optional)Modifier: Trim whitespaces (optional)Preview (required)Import Options (required)Schedule and Run (required)Managing Your Integrations (optional)FAQsSupplementary articles:Working with Custom Profile FieldsAdvanced MappingSelect Source Data stepWhen setting up an integration in Grip, theSelect Source Datastep is crucial for determining which data will be imported into your Grip platform. This step allows you to choose the specific data types from the source system and map them to the relevant Grip data types.Once you've set up the data types, you then have a choice about where to start the integration. By configuring start times and intervals, you can avoid redundant data pulls, ensuring that only the newest and most relevant records are retrieved. This gives you a greater flexibility in terms of:Manual 'pointer' input:You can manually set whether to pull data from a specific time or record, depending on the data source. This is great for targeted updates to specific sets of records.View of where the last integration stopped:You are able to see the last date used or record that was pulled in the integration. This provides greater clarity on the next starting point for data retrieval. Depending on the data source, this could be the date Grip last checked for records, the timestamp on the last record that was imported, or a specific record ID - the UI will change depending on the data source chosen to make this clear.Start from scratch:You can remove the existing date or ID to easily restart the integration from scratch without selecting an arbitrary early time window.Enhanced mapping and filtering:Pointer and time-window settings now apply to the Filter, Mapping, and Preview steps, making mappingmucheasier by allowing the selection of a known sample record that has the data you're looking for. A prompt will notify users if no data is available based on the selected criteria.Note that this depends on the data source chosen, as some registration systems don't support this kind of specificity - check the first step in the process for instructions particular to your data source.Display on integration detail page:The date of the last check, or the timestamp or ID of the last record imported is visible on the Integration Detail page, allowing you to access this information without editing the integration.Troubleshooting:No Data Available:If no data is retrieved while you're editing the integration, you'll be given some options about how to proceed. This is usually due to no 'new' records being available based on your current settings in theSelect source datapage.Consider selecting 'Retrieve all records' to temporarily ignore the settings on this page so that you can see some data in the following steps. Note that this doesnotremove these settings from the integration, it just allows you to continue through the steps with some sample data visible. When the integration next runs, the existing settings will be used.Filter Data stepThis section assumes you have already connected to your source event, selected the source data. Please refer to the source articles otherwise.Applies to:All Data sourcesIs this step required?NoThis section will provide steps on how to use the Filter Data feature on Grip Native Integrations. The Filter Data feature allows for you to select criteria to either allow or block specific records from being imported in your Grip event.On the left hand side of the page you will see 20 example records from your datasource, and on the right hand side will be where you select which filters to use to control the data¬† import into Grip.This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataWhen would I use this?You have registrants that have indicated that they do not want to participate in Grip Engage (Grip's AI-powered matchmaking and recommendation platform).You have attendees that have not paid for their tickets.You only want to import attendees that have completed their registration.Note: The strength of this feature depends on what information you capture during registration and what data is available from the datasource.How do I use this?1. Click the arrow in the drop down next to 'Select filter type'2. Select either 'Allow' or 'Block'Select 'Allow' if you want to import recordsSelect 'Block' if you want to exclude recordsNote: If you want to not use this feature, select 'No filter', click 'Next'. Under Select field', click the drop down arrow.3. Select the field that you wish to use from the data source. You can click the down arrow and scroll until you see the field, or use the search feature.4. Under 'Select Value', type in the value that you would like to use.Note: This will need to be an exact match, so capitalisation and whitespaces must be exactly the same as what will be coming from the data source.5. Click 'Add another rule' to add another field and/or value to filter on.Note: A record that satisfies at least one of the rules will be considered to have satisfied the filtering rule as a whole.6. Once satisfied with the filter rules configured, click ‚ÄúNext‚ÄùExamples of how a filter rule may help you:Scenario:You have attendees that have not paid for their ticketsData from source:For example, your records may have a field called 'paid'. Attendees that have paid have the value '1' and attendees that have not paid have the value '0'How to configure Filter Data feature:Choose 'Blocklist' as the filter type and select the field 'has_paid' and add '0' to the Values section to set up the filter rule for this integration.Scenario:You only want to import attendees that have completed their registration.Data from source:For example, your records may have a field called 'registration_completed'. Attendees that have completed the registration have the value 'complete' and attendees that have not completed have a value to indicate which step they are on in the registration process.How to configure Filter Data Feature:Choose 'Allowlist' as the filter type and select the field 'registration_completed' and add 'complete' to the Values section to set up the filter rule for this integration.Recommended Next Section:Map Data featureMap Data stepApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?YesThis section will provide steps on how to use the Map Data feature in Grip's Native Integrations. The Map Data feature allows for you to determine which data from your source you will import into Grip. It also lets you edit the data from the source before it is imported into Grip. Each of the editing options are further explained in their own sections.On the left hand side of the page you will see 20 example records from your datasource and on the right hand side will be where you select which of the fields to import into Grip. The first column will be used to indicate if a field is required to be imported into Grip, or not. The second column allows you to pick source field you wish to pull data from, or write your own data and formatting in free text. The third column labels the Grip field that the data will be imported into.This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersWhen would I use this?This feature is used to ensure the source data is appropriately mapped to each of the Grip fields. This allows you to have full control over what data each of your attendees will see and use in your event.How do I use this?There are three required fields to be able to import data into Grip:First NameEmailRegistration IDThese three fields and other commonly used fields have been automatically mapped to fields in the source data on what we recommend, but can be edited following the steps below.1. If a field is not indicated as required, and you do not wish to import it into Grip, click the check box under 'Do not Import'.Note: To import a field into Grip ensure that the 'Do not import' is not checked.2. To map a field from the source data, under 'Source mapping' begin type the field name in the text box or click the blue '+'If you click the blue '+' a new window will appear3. Click the down arrow next to 'Select'. Either use the search feature or scroll down until you see the field you want to select.4. Click Next5. You will then be prompted to select optional modifiers. Click 'Save' if you wish to use one, otherwise see the Optional Modifiers section to understandhow to use these Modifiers.6. To remove any source mapping, click the 'x' that appears next to the mapped source field.7. Repeat steps 1 through 2 for all of the rows.Note: You can map multiple fields to each row or even type in text between two fields. For example, You can map 'job_title' - 'company_name' to the Grip Field 'headline'.8. Multiple source fields can be mapped into a single Grip field. This applies to multiple choice Custom Fields and special metadata fields that support multiple values (e.g., Exhibitor ID).9. Click 'Next'Examples of how Map Feature will help you:Scenario:During registration you have asked your attendees for their job titles and wish to have this displayed in the Grip mobile app.Data from source:In your source data, the attendee‚Äôs job titles are contained in the field 'role'How to configure Map Feature:In the row that corresponds to the Grip field 'job_title', type in the word 'role' and ensure that the 'Do Not Import' check box is not checked.Mapping Link Custom Fields:At the bottom of the mapping step screen, you will see an option to import data into any Link custom fields that are assigned to the current data type. For best results, map multiple URLs in your source data to a single Link field in Grip - for example adding individual social media links all into a single 'Social Links' Grip Link field. This will look best on profiles within your event.A profile can have links added to it as part of the data load in your event. When links are added through a Native Integration, they are set up in the mapping screen. You canmap multiple source links in to a single Link custom field, each having their own optional title and description, which keeps URLs in profiles looking tidy.The system will handle missing data gracefully, adding only valid links and only showing URLs for links without names.Note that Native Integrations can only import single-language data for now.Recommended next section:Modifier: Capitalize the first letterModifiersModifier: Capitalize the first letterApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?NoThis section will provide steps on how to use the optional modifier 'capitalize the first letter'This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataWhen would I use this?Modifiers are completely optional and allow you to reconcile the differences in data between your source and Grip or fill in gaps if there are any.How do I use this?1. Open the 'Apply Optional Modifiers' for the source data you wish to modify.Note: This will automatically appear while mapping our source data or can be opened by click on the pen icon next to the mapped field name.2. Click 'Capitalize the first letter'Note: To remove this modifier, click on the 'x' or you can click 'Cancel‚Äô and it will remove any changes made since the last save.2. Click 'Save'Examples of how this filter rule may help you:Scenario:Some of your attendees have not capitalized the first letter in their Company name.Data from source:Company name is contained in the field 'exhibitor_name'.How to configure Optional Modifier Feature:Mapp 'exhbitor_name' to 'Company Name'. Open the Optional Modifier window and select 'capitalize the first letter.'Recommended next section:Modifier: Cut and take a portionModifier: Cut and take a portionApplies to:All Data sourcesIs this step required?NoThis section will provide steps on how to use the optional modifier 'Cut and take a portion'This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your data sourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataWhen would I use this?Modifiers are completely optional and allow you to reconcile the differences in data between your source and Grip or fill in gaps if there are any. This optional modifier will search for a value and perform one of the following depending on which option is selected. Below are examples of the different options available.e.g. Data: 123XABC; value to search for is XOptionResultCut and take everything after and excludingABCCut and take everything after and includingXABCCut and take everything before and excluding123Cut and take everything before and including123XHow do I use this?1.

Select the option 'Cut and take everything before and excluding' and for the letter or word type ', co.'Recommended next section:Modifier: Make all letters uppercaseModifier: Make all letters uppercaseApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?NoThis section will provide steps on how to use the optional modifier 'Make all letters uppercase'This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataWhen would I use this?Modifiers are completely optional and allow you to reconcile the differences in data between your source and Grip or fill in gaps if there are any.e.g. Your attendees have titles like CEO or DR and have not capitalized all of the letters when registering for the event.How do I use this?1. Open the 'Apply Optional Modifiers' for the source data you wish to modify.Note: This will automatically appear while mapping our source data or can be opened by click on the pen icon next to the mapped field name.2. Click 'Make all letters uppercase'Note: To remove this modifier, click on the 'x' or you can click 'Cancel‚Äô and it will remove any changes made since the last save.3. Click 'Save'Examples of how this filter rule may help you:Scenario:Your attendees have titles like CEO or DR and have not capitalized all of the letters when registering for the event.Data from source:Titles are contained in the source field 'suffix'How to configure Optional Modifier Feature:Map 'suffix' to 'last_name'. Open the Optional Modifier window and select 'Make all letters uppercase.'Recommended next section:Modifier: ReplaceModifier: ReplaceApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?NoThis section will provide steps on how to use the optional modifier 'Replace'. The modifier Replace lets you transform an incoming value in your source data to a replacement value, before importing it into Grip. You can also select to not import specific values. This feature also includes default options if a field is empty, does not match one of previously indicated values, or if the field is missing from the record entirely.This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataWhen would I use this?Modifiers are completely optional and allow you to reconcile the differences in data between your source and Grip or fill in gaps if there are any.The source data passes registration questions in a coded formatYou want to use Grip supply and demand CPFs, but the attendee registration data does not match the company registration data..How do I use this?1. Open the 'Apply Optional Modifiers' for the source data you wish to modify.Note: This will automatically appear while mapping our source data or can be opened by click on the pen icon next to the mapped field name.2. Click 'Replace'.Note: To remove this modifier, click on the 'x' or you can click 'Cancel‚Äô and it will remove any changes made since the last save.3. The following window will open:4. Under the 'From' column, type in the value that exists in the source.5. Under the 'To' column, type in the value that you would like to see instead, or select 'Do Not Import' if you do not want to import that value into Grip at all.6. Under 'Default setting and other options', you have the following options:If the field is emptyThis covers the condition where there is no value present in the mapped field. The default option is to 'Do Not Import', but if you unclick that option, you can enter in a value and all empty values will be replaced with the enter value before imported into Grip.If the field does not match anything and is not emptyThis covers the condition where there is a value present in the mapped field, but does not match one of the previously entered values. You can either not import these values, or import them as is.If the field is missing in a recordThis covers a similar condition as discussed in 'a' above, but this condition instead if the field does not exist for a record at all instead of just being empty. The default option is to 'Do Not Import', but if you unclick that option, you can enter in a value and all empty values will be replaces with the enter value before imported into Grip.7. Click 'Confirm'Pasting multiple cells of datainto theReplacetransformation function during mapping is also supported.This allows you to prepareFrom ‚Üí Toreplacement values in a spreadsheet and paste them directly into the dashboard.e.g. create two columns in any spreadsheet program. Your 'From' values go in column A and your 'To' values go in column B.Copy the data, select any 'From' cell in the Grip dashboard, and paste. You should see the values populate, with new rows being created automatically.If you want to exclude specific values from being imported, you can use the value"NO_IMPORT"(without quotes) in your spreadsheet instead of a replacement value (in column B).Examples of how this filter rule may help you:Scenario:The source data passes registration questions in a code.Data from source:You asked attendees why they are attending the event and the answers are contained in the field 'demo1'. If they responded that they want to network then the value in 'demo1' is 'A' and if they responded that they want to attend sessions, the¬† the value in 'dem1' is 'B'.How to configure Optional Modifier Feature:Map 'demo1' to a Grip CPF. Select 'replace' as an optional modifier. Configure the Replace optional modifier so that A will be replaced with Networking and B will be replaced with Attend Sessions.Scenario:You want to use Grip supply and demand CPFs, but the attendee registration data does not match the company registration data.Data from source:The source data contains which products attendees are interested in and one of the options is 'AI technology', This data is contained in the field 'interested'. You want to match this with the company data for products supplied of a value 'AI'.How to configure Optional Modifier Feature:Map 'interested' to a Grip CPF. Select 'replace as an optional modifier. Configure the replace modifier so that 'AI Technology' will be replaced with 'AI'.Recommended next section:Modifier: Trim whitespacesModifier: Trim WhitespacesApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?NoThis section will provide steps on how to use the optional modifier 'Trim Whitespaces'. Whitespaces are spaces that are entered in before or after a word or letter instead of appearing in between two words or letters. For example, the value 'Grip ' would be considered to have a whitespace that appears after a word.This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataWhen would I use this?Modifiers are completely optional and allow you to reconcile the differences in data between your source and Grip or fill in gaps if there are any.e.g. You want to add a suffix to the end of your attendees last name, but want to make sure that whitespaces will not cause odd spacing to appear.How do I use this?1. Open the 'Apply Optional Modifiers' for the source data you wish to modify.Note: This will automatically appear while mapping our source data or can be opened by click on the pen icon next to the mapped field name.2. Click 'Trim whitespaces'Note:To remove this modifier, click on the 'x' or you can click 'Cancel‚Äô and it will remove any changes made since the last save.3.

Open the Optional Modifier window and select 'Trim Whitespaces.' Enter in a space. Map 'suffix' to 'last_name'Recommended next section:PreviewPreviewApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?YesThis section will provide steps on how to use the Preview Feature. The Preview page allows you to look at the first 20 records from the source and confirm that the data imported into Grip will appear as you expect. You will be able to see a side by side preview of your decisions to compare your source data records with your destination data records in Grip.This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataApplied any optional modifiersHow do I use this?1. Compare the first record by using the side by side comparison.2. Click 'Next record' or 'Previous record' to toggle through the available records.3. If you are happy with the integration, click 'Next'. Otherwise, click 'Previous' to go back to the previous feature pages.Recommended next section:Import OptionsImport OptionsApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?YesThis section will provide steps on how to select the correct import option.Data integration is a complex matter; here are some important decisions to take so that you can configure the integration to treat existing data in your event the right way.We always recommend that you leave the import option at its recommended setting. However, there may be situations where you may want to pick a different import option.Add and include new data (Recommended):If a user has previously attended one of your events, this will add the user to the new event and update their data in the new event and any existing events. This includes the general profiles information or any shared CPFs shared across events.If the user is already in this event, then no action will be taken.If the user does not exist in any events, this will add the user based on the source data.Add but ignore new dataWhen a profile exists, but not in this particular event, then this will add it to the Grip Event butnotmodify any existing profile data. i.e. the profile will be added to the event, but anynewdata imported from the source will not be included.When a profile is already in the event, then no action will be taken.If the user does not exist in any events within the application, this will add the user based on the source data.Add and overwriteIf a user has previously attended one of your events, this will add the user to the new event and update their data in the new event and any existing events. This includes the general profile information and any Custom Profile Field information shared across events.When the profile already exists on the event, then this will update the profile information based on the data contained in the data source.If the user does not exist in any events within the application, this will add the user based on the source data.This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your data sourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataPreviewed your dataWhen would I use this?I am importing new attendees to an event that occurs every year.I am importing new attendees to a new event and I also have engagement hub active all year.I imported attendees to an event and I wish to make changes to their profiles before setting the event live.How do I use this?1. Select the import option that you would like to use.2. Read and accept any additional warning that may appear.3. Click 'Next'Examples of how the Import Options may help you:Scenario:I am importing new attendees to an event that occurs every year.Data from source:The native integration has been configured and contains some of the same CPFs from the previous year that the event was held. The attendees have updated their information in the registration form and I want it to be reflected in the new event.How to configure Import option:Select the option 'Add and include new data'Scenario:I am importing new attendees to a new event and I also have an engagement hub active all year.Data from source:the native integration has been configured and contains the same profile information from the engagement hub. Attendees in the engagement hub will also be attending this event. Attendees have updated their profile in the engagement hub, but not the source data.How to configure import option:Select the option 'Add and ignore new data'Scenario:I imported attendees to an event and I wish to make changes to their profiles before setting the event live.Data from source:The native integration previously ran and imported attendees into the event. I changed some mapping in the integration based on feedback from my team.How to configure import option:Select the option 'Add and overwrite'Recommended next section:Schedule and RunSchedule and RunApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?YesThis section will provide steps on how to Schedule and run your native integration.There are three options for when the integration will run:Do not Run: This saves the integration and does not run it.Run once at some time in the future: The integration will run once at the imputed time.On Repeat: The integration will run on the selected internal until requested to be stopped.Please note:Availability of recurring schedules is subject to licence plans and Schedules cannot exceed a month from when your event ends.You can make as many copies of your integration as you wish but only one of your copies may be active at a time for each pair of event and Grip data type. An active integration is one that is on a schedule (recurring or one-time) or is currently running.This section assumes that you have already performed the following steps:Connected your datasourceSelected the source eventSelected source dataSelected filtersMapped your source dataPreviewed your dataSelected your import option.When would I use this?I want to import data and allow the rest of my team to sign off on the integration.The integration is complete and I am to continue to import new attendees as them register.The integration is complete and all data that is needed is in my source.How do I use this?1. Click the down arrow next to 'Schedule this integration'2. Select one of the three options:Do not run: continue to step 3.Run once at some time in the future:At: Select the date and time you which the integration to run.In this timezone: Select the correct timezone for the above dateRepeatTo run every: Select how often the integration should run.Note that the options here are dependant on your data source, and on some plans additional options may be available once your event's start date is within 14 days. These options will be labelled as 'Live Event Boost'.Not before: Select when the integration should start running.Until: Select when the integration should stop running.In this timezone: Select the correct timezone of the above dates3. Under 'Give your integration a name', type a name for the integration or proceed with the configured integration name.4. Click 'Save'. Your integration is now saved. It can be reopened and edited in the future without needing to complete all steps.Examples of how a filter rule may help you:Scenario:I want to import data and allow the rest of my team to sign off on the integration.Data from source:I need additional signoff from my team before the integration can be considered complete and just need some sample data for review.How to configure Optional Modifier Feature:Select the schedule and run option to 'Do not Run / On- Demand'Scenario:The integration is complete and I am to continue to import new attendees as they register.Data from source:The integration has been completed and the whole team has signed on it.How to configure Schedule and Run:Select the schedule and run option 'On Repeat'. Ensure that it is not running more often than it takes for one run to complete, as this can cause further delays. Select it to start today and end the day after your event completes.Scenario:The integration is complete and all data that is needed is in my source.Data from Source:The integration has been completed and the whole team has signed off on it and I do not expect any new registrations.How to configure Schedule and Run:Select the schedule and run option 'Run once at some time in the future' and select some time in the future before the event goes live.Recommended next section:Managing Your IntegrationsManaging Your IntegrationsApplies to:All Data SourcesIs this step required?NoChange historyOnce on the Main Integration page, you can access the Change History by click on the eye icon.Changes made to your integrations are also tracked so that you may identify when and who updated them over time.You can also roll back any unwanted changes by selecting the desired version and clicking 'Rollback to this version'. A new version will automatically be created from this point. You can track a rolling total of the last 20 saved versions of each integration.Note. The schedule of execution is not considered in rollbacks. This means that a rollback of an integration will create a new version of your integration that will not have an active schedule.You can also clone an existing integration if you wish to reuse it to integrate with another data type. Cloned integrations will always be created without a schedule attached.LogsAs your integrations run, information about when and how they ran is tracked and made available to you via the dashboard. These are accessible if you click on the History tab.Logs are kept for each record processed in your run and these can be searched for using the email or registration id of the record.Each registration record that is retrieved or sent to Grip will be tracked and the processing outcome of it logged into the integration‚Äôs history and detailed logs for up to 30 days (rolling). These are accessible if you click on the 'eye' icon in the History Log, or in the 'Detailed Log' tab.FAQsData sourcesQ: What data sources can I connect to?A: see above for a list of the current sources.Q: I know Grip supports Data Source X, Why can‚Äôt I see it?A: Please contact Sales or your account manager for accessQ: I'm unable to connect to a data source as it has an IP address¬†Allowlist. What do I do?A: Some registration providers such as Visit by GES require you to add Grip‚Äôs IP addresses¬†to be able to use our native integrations. If required, please add the below 3 IP addresses¬†to your registration system:52.18.247.7834.253.163.18134.243.38.165Creating or editing integrationsQ: Why can‚Äôt I see a preview of my source data?A: Depending on the method of connection, some data sources may not always provide a preview of recordsQ: Why can‚Äôt I make mapping decisions on some Grip fields like 'name'?A: The name field is automatically derived from combining our first_name and last_name fields, no additional formatting is required for it.Q: Why am I unable to create an integration with a data source?A: The data source may be disabled temporarily for new integrations because of maintenance or other technical issues on the providerQ: I want to filter my records based on the presence or absence of a specific field. How can I do this?A: You can get the same outcome by using the Allowlist or Blocklist filter rule and providing all options. By implication, any record with or without that field present will be caught by your filter.Q: I‚Äôm integrated with Visit by GES, Why can‚Äôt I see partner data?A: Visit has two distinct setups for Visitor and Partner data. We have created a data source option for each of these. You should pick the specific data source for your needs.Q: Can I combine two source fields into a single destination field?A: Absolutely. You can add one or more source fields to any destination field on Grip by clicking on the + button. You can also provide any separator characters, such as commas or spaces, for your fields by typing them in place.Q: My source field contains list data, how will it appear in Grip?A: If your destination field is a multiple choice Custom Profile Field, then each of your list‚Äôs values will become a value in Grip. If your destination field is a freeform or single choice Custom Profile Field, then the list will be converted into a single comma separated value.Managing your integrationsQ: How many versions of my integrations can I track and roll back to?A: You can see up to 20 of the latest versions of your integration and roll back to any of themQ: Why can‚Äôt I run more than one copy of my integration at the same time?A: Each data source that Grip connects to has a set limit of how many active integrations are allowed. Exceeding these limits may cause your account on the data source to be suspended.Q: How long can I keep my integration running?A: You can run your integrations up to 30 days after your event is scheduled to end.Q: What happens when my integration is deleted?A: When you delete an integration, we will stop any ongoing integration at the point of deletion. in a safe manner. This means that you may still see updates appear after your deletion as we complete processing of any remaining records in your integration queue.When you delete your integration, the processing and change history of your integration will also be removed. Existing records processed by your integration in the past will remain available.Q: How far back can I look into my integration‚Äôs logs?A: You can see up to 20 previous saved versions of your integration, up to 20 previous executions (batches), and up to 30 days worth of processing historyQ: Does Event copying also copy over my integrations?A: Yes, when you copy an event, you will also copy over any integrations in that event. However, copied integrations will be set to on-demand and you will have to create a new schedule for them.Q: Can I clone my integration to another event?A: At present, integration cloning is only possible within the same event. However, integrations are copied over as part of Event Copying.Q: How can I pause my scheduled integration?A: At present, pausing is not supported. However, you can achieve the same effect by updating your integration to become an on-demand integration and perform a rollback to bring the schedule back.Q: Why is my integration disabled?A: We may temporarily disable an integration for a number of reasons. For instance, If you have requested support in investigating your integration, or if your data source provider is performing a maintenance event. This is a temporary measure and no other integration settings will be changed without your knowledge.Q: I‚Äôve seen my integration run at least once but no record has appeared on Grip. Why is that?A: There may be a number of reasons why this may be the case and your processing history logs will help you identify the cause. These are:Your filter rules may have eliminated these records from being retrieved by GripYour data source may be experiencing an outage or undergoing maintenanceYour import options may have eliminated these records from being processed by GripYour records are still being processed in your registration queue. We have a first-in-first-out queue for processing data to ensure that your records and any changes that come with them are processed in the correct orderQ: Can I change my integration configuration if my event is deactivated?A: No. You cannot create or amend any integrations for a deactivated event. However, you may delete integrations from it.Q: Can I manually enter a pointer for any data source?A: Pointers are supported by some but not all data sources. If supported, the option to input a pointer will be available.Q: What happens if I remove a pointer?A: Removing a pointer forces the integration to restart from scratch, fetching all available data as if no previous records had been processed.Q: Why should I use pointers in data mapping?A: Pointers help streamline the data mapping process by focusing on specific records, saving time and preventing unnecessary data retrieval.Working with Custom Profile FieldsNative Integrations supports custom profile field mapping but there are some finer details to be aware of when working with then.Freeform custom profile fieldsYou can map data to a freeform field just like any other field such as First Name or Job Title. If your source data has multiple values, they will be automatically joined together with a ','.Single choice custom profile fieldsYou can map data to a single choice field just like any other field such as First Name or Job Title.If your source data has multiple values, they will be automatically joined together with a ',' into a single value. Any previously unknown value will be imported and added to the list of 'hidden' values for that custom profile field.Multiple choice custom profile fieldsYou can map freeform, single choice or multiple choice data to a multiple choice field.Any previously unknown value will be imported and added to the list of 'hidden' values for that custom profile field. Native Integrations does not follow any user minimum or maximum value requirements for a multiple choice field. For example, you may map a source data field of just one value to a destination field even if the destination field requires a user to pick at least two values.Parent-child custom profile fields - basic supportIt is possible to map some basic data to a parent-child field by using the special characters '>>' between source fields. For this to work you will need to have asingle-field in your source datawhere all of the child categories come through. For example, if your source field is 'Room' and 'Category' with values that look like this:Rooms:Bathroom:StorageBathroom:FittingsBathroom:ToiletriesKitchen: UtensilsKitchen:CookwareKitchen:Small AppliancesThen your source field mapping should be just to theRoomsfield. You can then use a 'Replace' function for each value to add the parent in:From: "Bathroom: Storage" or "Storage"To: "Bathroom>>Storage"Your sample records will be presented in the preview page to you with values like 'Kitchen>>Cookware' or 'Bathroom>>Storage'.Any new child levels that have not been defined for the parent-child field will be created (as inactive values) with generic names like 'level 4' or 'level 6'.Multilingual supportWe do not currently have multilingual support for any field.Advanced MappingAt the bottom of the mapping window you may notice an expandable section called 'Advanced Mapping'. Once you expand it, you'll see a separate list of fields which will change depending on the kind of data type you're importing to (Participant, Company or Item).This area works in the same way as the section above, but the fields perform special functions while importing, or are used for specific purposes later in events.Here's a rundown of the available fields, what they do, and how they can be mapped to.Add Meeting Locations (by name)Available for: Participants, CompaniesThis field is used for assigning Meeting Locations to profiles - the most common usage being for Company profiles to be assigned their booths within an expo.This is a freeform text field, into which you need to map thenameof the meeting location(s) you'd like to create or assign.If a meeting location exists already with the same name, the profile will be added to it. If no meeting location exists with that name, one will be created, and will have the event's Default Meeting Settings applied (in the dashboard under Networking > Meetings > Meeting Locations > Default Location Settings).You can create and assign multiple locations per profile if you maponemultiple-choicesource fieldtoAdd Meeting Locations (by name).If you're manually entering the location names (e.g. every profile is being added to the same locations) you can also write a comma-separated list of location names if there is more than one.Add to Group (by ID)Available for: Participants, Companies, ItemsThis field adds the incoming profile to one or more Custom Groups which is essential for MustMeet or Hybrid events. Each Custom Group created in Grip has an ID which is what needs to be imported in this field.The Replace function is recommended here, as it allows you to take a value in your source field like 'Buyer Group' and turn it into a Group ID so that Grip can process it.You can dynamically map to multiple groups if you map toone multiple-choice source field, or if you manually write out the Group IDs and separate them with commas (which would add all profiles to the same set of groups).Add to Session as SpeakerAvailable for: ParticipantsAdding Session Registration IDs to this field will mean that incoming profile is added to that Session as a Speaker. Custom contributor roles are not supported, but of course profiles can be switched between roles later via the dashboard.Session Registration IDscan be created externally when sessions are imported, or automatically if a Session is created in Grip. You can find them in the dashboard when looking at a session - not to be confused with theSession ID, which is not used in this way.You can add multiple sessions by entering a comma-separated list of Session Registration IDs.Add to Session as AttendeeAvailable for: ParticipantsSimilar to the above, adding Session Registration IDs to this field will mean that incoming profile is added to that Session as an Attendee. This is the same action as a participant adding a Session to their Schedule, so in effect this is a way to pre-assign sessions.You can add multiple sessions by entering a comma-separated list of Session Registration IDs.Add to Session as SponsorAvailable for: Participants, Companies, ItemsAgain, as above, this field adds the incoming profile as a Headline Sponsor to Sessions. You can add one or more Session Registration IDs separated by commas or mapped from one multiple-choice field. Bear in mind that a Session can only have one Headline Sponsor.Sharer IDAvailable for: ParticipantsThis field is used in MustMeet events, for creating relationships between Sharers. It is an alternative to the normal field Exhibitor ID, for situations where only a portion of company representatives need to be set up as Sharers, and so the IDs need to be separated.In order to use this field, a custom Sharer relationship will need to have been created within the event first.Exclusive MeetingsAvailable for: ParticipantsUsed in MustMeet events, this field is used (along with Exhibitor ID) in order to denote participants that will have exclusive meetings. The only functional value that can be passed is "Exclusive Meeting".See ourarticle on exclusive meetingsfor more details.Meeting TargetAvailable for: ParticipantsUsed in MustMeet events, this field should contain the target minimum number of meetings that a participant should receive. This can only be expressed as a simple number, e.g. "10".See ourarticle on Meeting Targetsfor more details.Meeting LimitAvailable for: ParticipantsUsed in MustMeet events, this field should contain the maximum number of meetings that a participant can receive. This can only be expressed as a simple number, e.g. "10".See ourarticle on Meeting Targetsfor more details.Monetization Plan IDAvailable for: CompaniesThis field is used to pre-assign a Monetization plan based on its ID. This means that when the Team is created for this Company profile, the Team will be automatically assigned a particular Monetization plan, matching the ID in this field. See ourMonetization articlefor more details about plans.Monetization plan IDs can be found in the dashboard on the Monetization page, next to each plan. You can only assign a single ID for this field - e.g. "231".

Content:
Visit Connect embedded in GripThis guide explains how to set up Visit Connect for your event by ensuring the necessary configurations are made in both Visit and Grip.If you‚Äôre using Visit by GES for registration, you‚Äôll need Visit Connect for badge scanning. Visit Connect is a powerful tool that allows exhibitors to scan badges, capture lead notes, and share information across their teams. To make this process seamless, we‚Äôve partnered with Visit to enable event participants to use Visit Connect directly from within the Grip mobile application.What‚Äôs covered in this articleRequirements for Setting Up Visit ConnectData in VisitGrip RequirementsGrip requirementsHow to Create a Custom Field (CF)Setting Up Embeddable or Website URLsImporting VISIT Connect URLRequirements for Setting Up Visit ConnectData in VisitBefore using Visit Connect, ensure all exhibitor and exhibitor representative data exists within the Visit platform.This data can be added to Visit using one of the following methods:Manual uploadAPI integrationData importIf you have any questions about adding data to Visit, contact your Visit representative for assistance.Grip requirementsThere are a few prerequisites before integrating Visit Connect with Grip. These include:Creating a Custom Field (CF) to store unique Visit Connect URLs for each participant.Configuring Navigation Items in Grip to use personalized URLs linked to Visit Connect.How to create a custom profile fieldEach event participant using Visit Connect will have a unique URL associated with their profile. This URL, generated in Visit, must be stored in a Profile Field (PF) within Grip.Steps to Create the PF:Go to the Custom Fields Section: Navigate to theCustom Fieldsarea in Grip.Create a New Field: Configure the field with the following settings:Profile field not visible: Ensure participants cannot see the field.Profile field not editable: Prevent participants from editing the field.Profile field not filterable: Exclude this field from filters.Profile field can be used as Embeddable or Website URL: Enable this setting to allow the field‚Äôs data to be used for personalized links.Set Input Type to Freeform: Select ‚Äúfree-form only‚Äù as the input type.Name the Field: Provide a clear name for the field (e.g., ‚ÄúVisit Connect URL‚Äù).Assign Types: Choose the appropriate Data Types (e.g., Exhibitors or Representatives).Save the Field: Once configured, clickCreateto finalize the setup.Pro Tip: While creating the PF for Visit Connect, consider setting up other profile fields needed for your event to streamline the process.Setting up embeddable or website URLsTo make Visit Connect accessible for event participants, create aNavigation Itemin Grip. This item will use a personalized URL linked to the PF created in the previous step.Steps to create the navigation item:Add a New Navigation Item: In the Grip dashboard, create a new Navigation Item.Select URL Type: ChooseEmbeddable URLorWebsite URLdepending on how you want the link to display.Insert the Personalized URL:Use the PF created earlier as the source for the personalized URL.If the PF setup was correct, you‚Äôll see it listed as an available option.Finalize Navigation Item Settings:Select an appropriate icon for the Navigation Item.Assign it to the relevant Data Types (e.g., Exhibitors).Save the Navigation Item: Once everything is configured, clickSave.Note: Since Visit Connect is accessed individually, aPersonalized URLis required to ensure each participant is directed to their unique link.Importing Visit Connect URLsTo complete the integration, import the unique Visit Connect URLs into Grip.Steps to import Visit Connect URLs:Map the PF to the Source Data:In theMap Datasection of the Grip dashboard, map the Visit Connect URL field (e.g.,visitor.visitor-connect-url._text) to the PF you created.Ensure that the URL ends with?embedded=true. If it doesn‚Äôt, add?embedded=trueto the end of the URL during the mapping process.Verify Data Format: Ensure that the URL does not include spaces or unsupported characters.Complete the Integration: After mapping the PF, proceed with the rest of the integration configuration as normal.Tip: Double-check the URL mapping before proceeding to avoid issues with link functionality.

End of support and migration for Google Universal AnalyticsGoogle Analytics is one of the most widely-used data tracking and analytics platforms in the world, and Grip has supported event tracking through Google Analytics for some time. However, Google is making some changes, and have moved to a more modern system.What does this mean for event organizers?Google is deprecating tracking through the older ‚ÄòUniversal Analytics‚Äô properties from the1st of July 2023- meaning that if you don‚Äôt make any changes to your tracking by that time, you willstop seeing any data flowing into Google Analytics from Grip.As an event organiser you will still be able to use Google Analytics tracking in your Grip application, however you may need to make some adjustments in order to keep tracking, if you‚Äôre still using the old ‚ÄòUniversal Analytics‚Äô properties.

Title: What to expect following a Data Mapping call

URL: https://support.grip.events/what-to-expect-following-a-data-mapping-call

Content:
What to expect following a Data Mapping callThis article outlines the steps to validate and review the data integration process in Grip following the Data Mapping call.After the Data Mapping call, the integrations team will initiate a single data pull in the Grip platform by an agreed date. We will create a timeline working back from the earliest launch date and based on the complexity of the integration.It is important to review and ensure that the data is flowing correctly into Grip. During your review of the integration, it is your chance to request updates to ensure the data is being presented as you it need.Data Validation ChecklistTo facilitate a smooth integration process, please follow the checklist below:Attendee, Company, and Product DataTicket Types:Confirm that all ticket types are correctly imported into the respective data types in Grip and that only the requested ticket types are present.Field Mapping:Verify that all fields, such as headline, job title, location, and custom profile fields, are mapped as desired. Pay special attention to formatting, arrays, and HTML if applicable.Relationships:Double-check that relationships between representatives, companies, and products are accurately established.Custom Groups:Validate that custom groups are categorizing profiles correctly and appearing as intended on the front end.Permissions:Review permissions to ensure that the appropriate access levels are set for each data type.Data Completeness:Confirm that no data is missing during the integration process, with particular attention to custom profile fields (CPFs).MeetingsMeeting Locations:Ensure that all meeting locations are available in Grip and correctly linked to the corresponding profiles.Default Locations:If multiple meeting locations are linked to a profile, ensure the correct location is set as the default.Additional Locations:Verify that any additional meeting locations manually added are appearing correctly for the relevant data types.SessionsSession Fields:Check that all session fields, including name, description, stage, tags, and other relevant information, are mapped as desired. Pay attention to formatting, arrays, and HTML if applicable.Session Timing:Ensure that the session start and end times are correct.Attendance Accuracy:Verify that session attendance is recorded accurately, if applicable.Session Links:Ensure that all session links are working correctly, if applicable.Speaker Linking:Confirm that speakers are properly linked to their respective sessions, if applicable.Track Visibility:Check permissions to ensure the correct attendee types can see the appropriate tracks.Private Sessions:Review private sessions to ensure the correct attendees can see these sessions and/or have them added to their schedule.Timeline for ReviewTo allow sufficient time to address any potential issues, it is advisable to complete the review at least 5 working days before the event launch. This timeline provides time for necessary modifications or troubleshooting before the event begins, ensuring a smooth experience for all participants.FAQsWhen should I start reviewing the data integration?It is recommended to begin your review immediately after the data pull is completed to allow ample time for any adjustments.What should I do if I find discrepancies in the data?If any discrepancies are found, promptly request updates through the Grip delivery/integrations team to ensure data accuracy before the event.Is there a limit to how many updates I can request?There is no hard limit, but it is best to request all necessary updates in a single communication to streamline the process.

Title: Data scraping

URL: https://support.grip.events/data-scraping

Content:
Data scrapingn this article, we will shed light on data scraping and Grip‚Äôs approach to this subject.What is data scraping?Grip‚Äôs positionWhat can I do to minimise scraping of my event?Policies & legal action associated with data scrapingWhat is data scraping?Data scraping is a technique where a computer program extracts information from another program's output. Web scraping is a common form of data scraping, where an application gathers valuable data from a website. People often scrape websites to reuse content, create alternative interfaces, or for research purposes. This is a challenge faced by all web applications.How is it done?Data scraping can be done manually or automatically and utilizes various methods:Spiders: These programs follow links on websites to gather specific data.Shell Scripts: Basic scripts using Unix tools to download and extract data.HTML Scrapers: Extract data based on HTML patterns.Screen Scrapers: Use real browsers to extract data from web pages.Web Scraping Services: Professional scraping services often employ proxies to overcome restrictions.Embedding and Mobile Apps: Websites can be embedded in other pages or mobile apps.Copy-and-Paste: People manually copy and paste content for various purposes.Grip‚Äôs positionGrip aims to prevent data scraping by existing behind a log in, limiting abusive usage, and constantly changing its environment to deter automated scraping. The event industry poses some unique challenges due the significant peak and troughs in usage and the release of attendee lists to registered users, which can include data scrapers.What can I do to minimise scraping of my event?Not having an ‚Äòattendee list‚Äô is going to have a significant impact in making it much harder to scrape your event.Not using the guest and anonymous login features will mean that only people that have bought a ticket can access Grip, thus deterring scraping.Badge scanning and the potential for data scrapingAs explained in our article on Badge Scanning in order to avoid data scraping or nefarious activity, we strongly advice making sure your registration system supports at least 10 characters of randomised alphanumeric Scan_IDs for the QR /barcodes on the badge. We have advanced monitoring in place to catch any nefarious usage associated with scanning of badges but it‚Äôs vital that a complex schema for Scan_IDs is used.Policies & legal action associated with data scrapingRegardless of whether it is on Grip or on any other platform such as your website, we recommend ensuring your Terms & Conditions and/or ‚ÄúFair Use Policy‚Äù strongly outlines that data scraping is not allowed. It might help to outline the consequences of such activity, (e.g. removal from the event, legal action etc).We recommend you work with your general counsel and/or an external law firm on this; Grip might be able to recommend a law firm depending on your geography, please ask your account manager for more information.

Third Party IntegrationsAt Grip, we want to allow you to use the tools that best suit your event needs. You can do this through our third party integrations.In this article, we will cover:What are third party integrationsHow to add third party integrationsWhich integrations can I add to Grip?How do I find my IDsIntegrations - in depthCookie consentWhat Are Third Party Integrations?Third party integrations are the ability to give additional platforms access to your event page or event data. This then allows you to perform actions that either Grip does not currently offer, ie customer chat or screen recordings.It also allows you to push data into platforms that your organisation already uses in order to make comparisons or just to be able to access and analyse data more easily. For instance, over half of all US companies use Google Analytics so we offer the ability to integrate Google Analytics with your Grip app so you can keep all of your data in one place, in a familiar format.How To Add Third Party IntegrationsOur integrations are currently set at an application level, meaning that the code you add for your third party integrations will be used across every event within the application.In order to add these integrations, go toApp Settingsin the Grip dashboard, click on theApp Configuration & Special Actionspage and scroll to the Third Party Integrations section. If you cannot see the page, you will need to speak to a member of the Grip Delivery team in order to add the code for you.Enter the relevant ID in the corresponding field and clickSaveat the top of the section.For example, if you need to add a Google Tag Manager code, go toApp Settingsin the Grip dashboard, click on theApp Configuration & Special Actionspage, scroll to theThird Party Integrationssection and add the code under the Google Tag Manager field - then clickSave.Which Integrations Can I Add To Grip?We are always adding new integrations to Grip, at present, you can add:ZendeskIntercomHotjarHubspotGoogle AnalyticsGoogle Tag ManagerHow Do I Find My IDs?1.

Title: How do I upload sessions using a spreadsheet?

URL: https://support.grip.events/session-csv-uploader

Content:
How do I upload sessions using a spreadsheet?Manage your sessions and their content in bulk via a spreadsheetThe session CSV uploader provides an efficient and accurate way to upload session data into Grip. By using easy-to-fill templates, event organizers can quickly create or update sessions in bulk, streamlining the management of event agendas. This article will guide you through using the session uploader, highlighting the differences from the bulk profile uploader and offering best practices for a smooth process.In this article, we will cover:Use cases and informationUsing the bulk profile uploaderFAQUse cases and informationThe session bulk uploader is designed to quickly create or update multiple sessions at once. This tool is particularly useful when you need to:Add new sessions to an event in bulk.Update existing session information across an event‚Äôs agenda.Utilize templates that can be prefilled with existing session data, allowing for mass updates with minimal manual input.Whether you're adding simple session details like names and descriptions or more complex data like custom fields and links, the bulk uploader simplifies the process, ensuring consistency and accuracy across your event.Using the bulk session uploaderStep 1: Select an EventIf you haven't already, select the event you want to update.Step 2: Navigate to Event AgendaGo toEvent Details > Event Agenda.Step 3: Start the Bulk Upload ProcessClick on theCreate Sessionbutton, and from the drop-down menu, selectUpload in Bulk via Spreadsheet.Step 4: Downloading the Right TemplateChoose the appropriate template for your needs:Simplified Template:For basic session details like names, descriptions, and a live stream link.Full Template:For more detailed session information, including custom fields and additional session links.You can preview the fields included in each template by clicking the 'Template Fields' dropdown.Note:If you have already downloaded the template, you can skip directly to the upload step.Step 5: Prefilled TemplatesIf you want to update existing sessions, enable the option toPrefill with Existing Session Data. This will include all current sessions in the event within the downloaded template, making it easy to edit and re-upload.Separator symbolsIf you choose to download a prefilled template, you'll be asked what symbol you'd like to use to separate any multiple choice data fields. For a full explanation of what a separator is, please seethis dedicated section in the profile uploader article.The uploader will remember this choice on the next step when you come to re-upload the data.Step 6: Handling Separator SymbolsIf you download a prefilled template, you‚Äôll need to choose a separator symbol for any multiple-choice data fields. For more details on separator symbols, refer to the relevant section in the profile uploader article.The uploader will remember your chosen separator symbol when you re-upload the data.Step 7: Notes on the .CSV File TypeThe template you download will be in .csv format, which is compatible with most spreadsheet software. Be sure to:Keep the File Format:Do not save the spreadsheet in a different file format; it must remain a .csv file to be uploaded successfully.Preserve the Layout:Do not alter the layout, such as removing header rows, as this could cause errors during upload. However, you can remove non-mandatory columns if they are not needed.If you encounter issues with CSV files, refer to our article on handling CSV fileshere.Step 8: Filling Out the SpreadsheetOnce downloaded, fill out the spreadsheet with the necessary data. Use the tables provided in theAvailable Informationsection to correctly input data into special fields:Available Session Types:Indicate the type of session you are creating.Available Stages:Verify the stage compatibility using the stage ID or create a new stage by entering its name.Available Tracks:Use the existing track ID or create new tracks by filling in the track name field.Available Custom Fields:Copy values from the active custom fields in your event to ensure consistency.Step 9: Uploading Your Completed SpreadsheetChoose your upload method:Create New Sessions Only:Adds new sessions and ignores any sessions with a matching Registration ID.Create New Sessions and Update Existing Sessions:Adds new sessions and updates any existing ones with a matching Registration ID.Next, select the .csv file from your computer, choose the appropriate separator symbol if applicable, and clickContinue.Step 10: Review Upload ResultsAfter uploading, you‚Äôll be directed to a review page. If everything looks good, clickView Uploaded Sessionsto return to the event agenda page. Note that large uploads may take some time to process.Step 11: Handling Failed SessionsIf any sessions fail to upload, a table will list the issues, allowing you to correct them and re-upload the file. Common reasons for failures include:Missing required fields.Incorrect data or formatting in date/time fields.Invalid URLs.Grip validates this information to prevent problems during your event. Correct any errors and try uploading again.Special FieldsThere are a number of special fields that can be used to perform certain functions while sessions are imported or updated. Each column in the spreadsheet has its own description to help you understand its purpose, and each one matches an option available when you create a session manually in the dashboard - for example, adding an Audience Interaction URL, or adding a sponsor to a session. Seethis section on the Event Agenda articlefor details regarding the different features of Sessions.FAQQ: Why do I see an error about time-blocking sessions when I haven't made any sessions time-blocking?A:This error could relate to either existing sessions in your event or other sessions in your upload spreadsheet. Check both for overlaps. Time-blocking is relevant for sessions marked as mandatory, as they appear in all participants‚Äô schedules, preventing overlaps with other sessions. Adjust the session timings or make them non-mandatory to resolve this issue.Q: Can I update sessions without changing their existing Registration IDs?A:Yes, when you upload a spreadsheet using the "Create new sessions and update existing sessions" option, the Registration IDs of existing sessions will remain unchanged. This allows you to update session details without affecting their identifiers.Q: What happens if I upload a spreadsheet with missing mandatory fields?A:If any mandatory fields are missing, the affected sessions will fail to upload. You will see a detailed error message specifying which fields are missing. Correct these errors in your spreadsheet and try uploading again.Q: Can I include new custom fields in my session upload?A:Yes, you can include new custom fields by ensuring they are added to the template before uploading. Make sure the custom fields match those configured in your event to avoid errors.Q: How do I ensure that the session data in the spreadsheet matches the required format?A:Refer to the "Available Information" tables when filling out the spreadsheet. These tables provide correct formats for data such as dates, times, and URLs. Additionally, each column in the spreadsheet includes descriptions to guide you.Q: Is there a limit to the number of sessions I can upload at once?A:While there is no strict limit, very large uploads may take longer to process. If your upload is particularly large, it may be more efficient to split the sessions across multiple uploads to ensure smooth processing.Q: Can I use the bulk uploader to delete sessions?A:No, the bulk uploader is designed for creating and updating sessions only. To delete sessions, you must do so manually through the event dashboard.Q: Will theSession IDandSession Stage IDautomatically populate when I upload?A:Session ID: This field is used to link sessions with related elements, such as speakers. Each session must have a unique ID. You can manually assign one by entering a value in the spreadsheet, or leave it blank for the system to generate one automatically during the upload. Avoid using spaces or special characters such as<,>,#,@,(,)when creating your own Session IDs.Session Stage ID: This field connects the session to a specific stage or location. You can provide either theSession Stage IDor theSession Stage Namein your upload. If neither is provided, the session will not be linked to a stage. Use the values listed under "Available Stages" in your event setup to ensure accuracy.

With this feature, organisers can now categorise their videos into groups within their video library. The benefit of this is that organisers have more flexibility in how they display their content for attendees.In addition to organising videos, groups can also be utilised when setting up the navigation for the video library. This means that event organisers have complete control over the arrangement of each view in the library. There's also a "See All" option for each group, allowing organisers to view all videos within that group, much like a filter.How to create video groups?1. In your video library on the dashboard, click on the Groups tabs. You will see the option to create your first video group.2. Next, you will be prompted to name your first group. Click on the flag to name your group in different languages. Once you have done this, click on save changes button on the top of the table.3. You will be able to edit the name of your group by clicking on the pencil icon. To delete the Group, click on the bin icon.

Assign videos to your Groups in the manage content tab. Find the video you want to add to a group, then click on the edit video settings cog on the top right of the video card.2. This will open the Edit video where you can select the groups you have created and assign them to the video.

You can also order the Group, by using the up and down arrows to move each group.What will your event participants see on the web platform?When your event participants select the navigation item that you have created, they will see Videos groups that you have configured and assigned. More videos will be visible in the group after the user has selected ‚ÄòShow All‚Äô. A number will show that indicates the number of videos that are part of the group.The event participants will also be able to use the filter and select which Group they want to see.Video TagsThese are tags that can be added and assigned to videos in your video library. Key benefits of using this feature include:For event organisers:Better categorization: Event organisers can use tags to streamline video library managementIncreased engagement: If participants can find what they want with less friction, they‚Äôll be more likely to stay in your event for longerFor event participants:Improved filtering: event participants can easily filter and find videos with those tags in the video library.How to add video tags?1. The first step is to create a 'Video Tag Collection'. As the name implies, here¬†is where you will be able to create a collection of video tags, which will allow you to assign tags to your videos.Within your video library, there is a tab called Tag collection. Once in this tab select ‚ÄúCreate video tag collection‚Äù2. Name¬†your Video Tag Collection on the field then click 'Create video tag collection'. In this case, we're using ' Tags' as an example.Note that this label will be shown to users on the web platform on the filter. This label is also multi-language so you can create a label for your tag collection for each language you have configured for your event.3. Select 'Add rows' at the top right of the table. This will add rows for you to now add your tags.4. Add your tags and then click on 'Save new video tags'5. Manage tags by selecting the tag you wish to edit and choose one of the options provided: 'Display selected', 'Hide selected', or 'Delete selected'. Note that deleting tags that are already associated with a video will remove this association and will no longer be part of the video that it was associated with.6. After completing these steps, you'll find your new tag collection:a) Under 'Tag Collection' in the video libraryb) And on the 'Manage Content' section at the top of the page. You can use this to manage which videos have tags based on your selection.7. You are now ready to assign these tags to videos. Click on the settings icon on the top right of each video card. This will open the settings bar for the video selected. You will find your new tag collection. In this example, you can see it's called ‚ÄúTags‚Äù.You can assign more than one tag to a video as seen in the example below.What does this look like for your web participants?Event participants can easily filter and find videos with those tags in the video library.Video Carousel Block on Home FeedIntroducing our new video home feed block - the perfect way to showcase your best videos on the homepage and drive engagement on the platform!

As such, event organizers can enable different links within event agenda Sessions to take their event to the next level.In this article, we'll cover the different links that can be enabled and how participants can interact with them on both web and mobile. Many of these links have specific and intended functionality and will appear in different ways, but how you use them is up to you.Livestream URLVideo Recording URLSession Content URLWebsite URLPolling and Q&A URLAudience Interaction Embed URLLink-type custom fieldsLivestream URLEnable the 'Livestream URL' on the dashboard so that event participants can watch a live session. Full details on how to do this can be found in thisguide.On web, there are two ways this can be displayed to viewers:1. Embedded in the session pageGrip allows event organizers to embed livestream sessions in the platform. Organiser can add a Zoom meeting URL to a session via the dashboard (see guide linked above)This means when a participant views the session page the live stream video provider, ie. Zoom, is embedded in the page, allowing participants to watch the live video directly in the Grip app without being redirected to a third party site.2. Linking externallyYou can also re-direct viewers to an external link outside of Grip (e.g Youtube) to watch your livestream session.In this case, the livestream will not be shown on the session and participants will have to click on the 'Watch Livestream' button that links to an external page.On mobile: Whether the livestream is embedded or links to an external page, participants will see a 'Watch livestream' button that links to the sessionVideo Recording URLEnabling the 'Video Recording URL' allows organizers to share recorded sessions after the livestream is finished.On web, there are two ways this can be displayed to viewers:1.

This will appear to participants as a 'Get Session Content' button on both web and mobile.Please note that some hosted file URLs may not open on mobile devices correctly. For example, rather than uploading a hosted PowerPoint file, consider uploading a hosted PDF version of the slides for best device compatibility.On web:On mobile:Website URLYou can share a link to an external website by enabling the 'Website URL' in the dashboard.On web:¬†this will appear to participants as an 'Open Session Link' ¬†button.On mobile: participants will see the link to the websitePolling and Q&A URLYou can enable the 'Polling and Q&A URL' in the dashboard to link to any third-party site if you wish to engage with viewers during a session.

This will appear to participants as a 'Polling and Q&A' button on both web and mobile.On web:On mobile:Audience Interaction Embed URLThis allows you to add a link which is then embedded into the sidebar on the right of the session details page, visible for your attendees while they watch a session.This functionality is only available on web:This can be used to allow Event Organizers to load interactive content from a third-party site into Grip, which could give attendees the option to take part in a live poll, or other audience interaction tool. You will also need to specify a name for your link, which will appear to your viewers when they watch the session.Note that you have the option to ‚Äúpersonalize‚Äù the Audience Interaction Embed URL, which means that you can create a URL that is slightly different depending on the user that loads it. This works in the same way as thePersonalised URL Navigation Itemoption, where you can specify a part of the URL to be dynamic. The example below uses a Custom Profile Field (sent as part of registration) to load each user‚Äôs email address into the URL, in order to have the user log into a Q&A web tool automatically.Link-type custom fieldsFor any other type of link, you can createsession custom fieldsand use the 'Link' type - and you can create as many of these links (and link fields) as you like.We'd recommend that you create a single link-type session custom field, with a name that will work for any of your sessions - e.g. "Additional Links". Then when editing a session in the dashboard you can add the URL along with a name and description to make it clear what each individual link does. Even when using a single link field, you can add multiple links to any sessions, and each session can have its own set of links.The links will always open externally in a new tab (on the web), or in a 'web-view' if you're using a mobile app.If you have any questions or suggestions you can reach out to us onsupport@grip.events

Due to this distinction, Private sessions are the only sessions that have an invitee list as well as a list of attendees (those that have added it to their schedule).12. Set your session attendee limit. If you have this turned off, the session will inherit the limit of the session Stage. This is a global limit, regardless of data type or group.13.

Title: How to Use Custom Fields in Your Event Agenda

URL: https://support.grip.events/custom-fields-for-sessions

Content:
How to Use Custom Fields in Your Event AgendaCustom fields are a powerful tool for enhancing your event sessions, just as they are for profiles.They allow you to display additional information such as web links, topics, or text, making it easier for attendees to understand what each session offers at a glance. By leveraging session custom fields, you can also improve search results by enabling pre-filtering based on these fields, similar to how profile custom fields work.Currently, session custom fields can be used to:Display various types of information within a session, such as web links, topics, or simple text.Enhance search accuracy for participants by enabling pre-filtering with session custom fields in the Event Agenda, similar to how profile custom fields work.With the latest updates, session custom fields now offer functionality comparable to profile custom fields, as they are fully integrated and natively attached to sessions.In this article, we will cover:How to manage Session custom fieldsHow to create Session custom fieldsHow to add data to Session custom fieldsFAQHow to manage Session custom fieldsTo manage session custom fields, navigate to the Grip dashboard, select your event, and go toEvent Details > Custom Fields. Here, you will find two tabs: one for profile custom fields and another for session custom fields. Click on the second tab to manage session fields.In this table, you will see all the custom fields available for the current event, including multi-event fields from the current Grip application and any single-event fields created for this event. The information displayed is similar to the profile custom fields tab, but with two additional columns:Active in event: Determines whether a field can be used in the current event. If a field is active, it will appear within sessions in the Grip dashboard for data entry. Inactive fields cannot be used for sessions in the current event.Visible: Indicates whether information in this field will be visible to event attendees within sessions.Note:You need App Admin privileges to modify multi-event fields, as these changes can affect other events. However, even without App Admin privileges, you can still make multi-event fields active for the current event directly from this page.Active in eventSession custom fields can be created as multi- or single-event fields and are managed in the same way as profile custom fields. Permissions for session fields are very similar to profile field permissions, but with one difference - Session custom fields have a simple 'Active' control, so that you can choose which of your fields are available to all of the sessions within the current event, or none of them.If a field is active it will appear within the sessions in the Grip dashboard for you to add data to it. If a field is inactive, you cannot use it for sessions in the current event.This is different to the 'Visible' control, as shown in the table above.You'll need to be an App Admin to make changes to a multi-event field as you will be making changes that could affect other events. If you do not have App Admin privileges, you can still make multi-event fields active within the current event, directly from this page.Custom field settingsClicking on the Settings cog will take you to the custom field options page.Again, this is extremely similar to the profile custom field page, but with fewer options - we recommend that you read themain custom fields articlefor in-depth details about the options shown on this page. If you can't see an option you're expecting to, it's because it's not appropriate for Session custom fields.How to create Session custom fieldsAs before, this process is effectively identical to the process to create a profile custom field. You can create a Session custom field from two places in the dashboard:From the Session custom fields tab:While editing a session in Event Agenda, from the custom fields tab:Both places will take you to the same creation page, although once finished you will be taken back to the page that you started at.If you are an App Admin or above, you will be prompted about whether you want to create a multi-event field, or just a single-event field. Again, multi-event fields are recommended unless you don't plan on using this field again in future events.Fill in the options on the page just as you would a profile custom field. Once saved, you'll either be taken to the second tab for entering pre-defined values, or back to the page you came from.While the options on this page allow you to specify AI matching types and connect Session fields to Profile fields with a supply/demand relationship, this currently does not affect recommendations. This functionality will be released in the coming months.How to add data to Session custom fieldsOnce your fields are created and active in your event, you can add data to them that will display in your sessions to your attendees. The simplest way is through the dashboard, through editing a session. Alternatively, for large amounts of data, it's better for this data to come in to Grip via a custom integration.Via the dashboardGo toEvent Details>Event Agenda. On this page you can see a list of your sessions, and you can use the column selector to show any existing custom field data that's been created.Adding data to an individual session:Click on the Settings cog to edit a Session, or you can create a new session.If you're editing a Session, you can click on the Custom fields tab at the top.If you're creating a new Session, you'll need to add some basic details first, and clickSave and continue.On the Custom fields tab you'll see sections for each type of custom field that can be used. These contain all of the fields that are currentActivein the current event - controlled from the main Session Custom Fields page. If there are no active fields available, you'll be shown a link to that custom fields page in order to make at least one active.You can always create a brand new custom field from here too, if you need to - once created you'll be returned to this same session so that you can carry on editing.You can expand each section to see a list of fields, and directly edit the information for each field that will be used in this session. Forpre-defined fields, you can choose from a list of values that have already been created for that field. To modify these or add more, you'll need to edit the field itself and go to the 'values' tab.In multi-language events, you can use the language selectors to view and edit data in other languages:Forpre-defined fields, we tie translations for individual values together so as to keep them in sync. This means that you canonly editwhile viewing in English. Changes are then saved automatically in other languages.Forfreeform fields, you must edit in all languages available. For any languages that are left blank, we fall back to the default English data.Forlink fields, you can edit in all languages, for each individual link's field. For any languages that are left blank, we fall back to the default English data.If you want to empty a field, click theClearbutton next to it.Once you're happy with the changes, clickSave changes.Adding data to multiple sessions at once:You can add and replace custom field data to multiple sessions using the bulk edit feature - select at least one session, click on Actions > Edit, and a sidebar will open with options for custom fields. See the'Editing a session' section in our main Event Agenda dashboard articlefor more details.Alternatively, you can use the Session bulk uploader as detailed below.Uploading using Session spreadsheet uploadWhen you need to create or update sessions, you can choose to do so in bulk from the Event Agenda page by clicking 'Create session' and selecting upload via a spreadsheet. Pleasesee this articlefor full details on the Session bulk uploader.When downloading the CSV spreadsheet template, anyactivecustom fields for sessions will be included as columns in the spreadsheet. If you've downloaded a template that's pre-filled with your existing Sessions, you'll also see any custom field values attached to those listed.Simply add or amend the values that you want to add for each session you're uploading, and those values will be added to those sessions, and will be created if it doesn't already exist.For multiple-choice fields, you can use the pipe symbol|as a separator between values.Multi-Language events:For multi-language events, you'll see a column for each language supported in the application.When uploading values that don't already exist, please make sure you fill out all available language columns. If any language is not filled out, your attendees using the platform in that language will see the default English value instead.When uploading values that have already been created for the current field, you only need to add the default English value on to your spreadsheet, and the system will match it to the existing value.There is one exception - Link type fields are not included as columns in the bulk upload templates. This is due to the fact that each link can include a title and description as well as the link itself, and spreadsheets do not have the format to handle this kind of dense information within a single column - especially for multi-language events.It is quicker to add links via the public API or through editing Sessions one-by-one in the dashboard.Via a custom integrationCustom integrations, managed by our Solutions team, allow you to pull data from almost any source via a public API. Speak with your Grip contact for more information. After creating or activating the fields, you can find the system name for each field on the Session Custom Fields page, which is necessary for integration setup.You can see this system name in a few places:While hovering your cursor over the field name on the Session custom fields page:On the field's settings page:When editing a Session, you can hover over a custom field name:Once you know these field system names you can pass them to your Grip contact for use in your integrations.FAQsQ: Can I use session custom fields to improve session recommendations?A: Not yet. This feature is under development, so keep an eye out for future updates.Q: How do I manage custom fields across multiple events?A: Use multi-event fields if you plan to reuse a custom field across different events. You‚Äôll need App Admin privileges to make these changes.Q: Can I edit session custom fields for multiple sessions at once?A: Yes, use the bulk edit feature or the Session bulk uploader for efficient management of multiple sessions.Q: What happens if I don‚Äôt fill out all language fields for a multi-language event?A: Attendees viewing the platform in an unfilled language will see the default English value.

Content:
How session sponsorship works and how to set it up?This article explains how you, as an event organizer, can set up sponsored sessions on the Grip dashboard and help companies generate leads through two methods: passive sponsorship and active session check-in.Using the Grip Dashboard, you can enable sponsors to collect leads from event participants in two key ways:Passive sponsorship:Companies generate leads when participants add their sponsored sessions to their personal schedules.Active session check-in:Sponsors or event staff scan participants' QR codes as they enter sessions, creating leads even if the session was not added to their schedule.Before You StartTo ensure everything works correctly:Every sponsored session must have at least one company profile assigned.If no company is linked to a session, the session check-in data will not be available for export.Teams must be activatedfor lead capture and session check-in data to be available on the event platform. Leads will only be generatedafterthe Team is activated.Table of contentsWays to collect leads from sponsored sessionsOption 1: Passive Lead Collection (Sponsor visibility)Headline sponsorSession contributorOption 2: Active Lead Collection (Session Check-In Scanning)Managing and exporting scanned dataFAQsWays to collect leads from sponsored sessionsGrip gives you two ways to allow sponsors to generate leads from sessions:Passive Lead Collection‚Äî Companies sponsor a session and automatically generate leads when participants add the session to their schedule.Active Lead Collection‚Äî Sponsor company representatives physically scan event participants into sessions to collect leads.Option 1: passive lead collection (Sponsor visibility)To allow companies to passively collect leads, you‚Äôll assign them as sponsors within the session setup. There are two ways to do this:A. Headline sponsorThis sponsor receives the highest visibility on the event platfrom.What event participants see:The company‚Äôs logo and the ‚ÄúSession Sponsor‚Äù tag appearin the main Event Agenda, before participants click into the session.The company‚Äôs logo and the ‚ÄúSession Sponsor‚Äù tag are also visibleinside the session details pageonce participants click into the session.How to set it up on the Grip Dashboard:Go toEvent Agenda > SessionsClick into a sessionNavigate to theSettingstabAssign theHeadline Sponsor‚ö†Ô∏èOnly one Headline Sponsor is allowed per sessionHow it works in the event platform:Participantscan add the session to their schedule.If the sponsor‚ÄôsTeam is activated, event participants who add the sessionafter the Team is createdbecome leads and show up in the sponsor‚ÄôsMy Team > LeadssectionB.

Title: Session Recommendations

URL: https://support.grip.events/session-recommendations

Content:
Session RecommendationsIn the article below, you can delve into more information about session recommendations and the factors shaping them.Understanding Session RecommendationsGrip offers the flexibility for sessions to be recommended, although it's not mandatory. Sessions not listed as being recommendable won't appear in the recommendations, and event participants can easily manage them on their My Schedule page, choosing to skip or add as desired.Recommendations are produced when specific changes happen, or daily if no relevant changes occur. A maximum of 5 recommendations per person is made in a day, to stop participants from being deluged and thus ignoring recommendations.What are Session Recommendations based on?Recommendations are primarily based on expressions of interest. These expressions can come in various forms.Connections with SpeakersThis is relatively rare, but if a person has a connection with a speaker at a session, this is considered a strong expression of interest. Not only are you interested in the speaker, but they are interested in you, and thus likely a first choice attendee. Any sessions they speak at would likely be recommended if possible.Interest actions on SpeakersIt is more common for a person to express one-way interest in a speaker - since that does not also require the interaction of the speaker. This is also considered an expression of interest and will be used to create recommendations. Sessions they speak at will be recommended to that individual if possible.AI-based interest in SpeakersPerhaps more abstractly, recommendations of sessions are also made if the AI has identified a reason you would be interested in the speaker. Typically it needs more information about you to make this decision to the certainty needed here, so it is rarer. However, some recommendations are created based on this expected interest.Sessions that your connections are already attendingA simple but effective strategy is to recommend sessions based on what your connections are already attending. Performance will depend on the kind of event, or more specifically, the most common kind of connection that's happening.For example, in a content-focused event where the objectives are to stay up to date with industry trends, participants are likely to be connecting with people in similar roles, or who have similar interests. However, in events that are more sales-driven, connections will usually happen between buyers and suppliers who actually may have compatible but opposite roles, and so content may not be mutually interesting.Speed Networking Recommendations:Speed Networking sessions are a little different from other types of sessions as they do not have speakers, and are instead sets of 1:1 auto-generated meetings for those attending.These sessions will be recommended specifically if any of your connections or individuals you have shown interest in have added these sessions to their schedules. This is considered a strong expression of interest because not only are your connections or interests present, but it is likely that there will be other people similar to them attending as well. This increases the likelihood that you will have an interest in others attending this session.Speed Networking have proven to be a time-efficient way for attendees to make meaningful connections and have productive meetings within a short time frame. They are often used as an introductory platform for participants to get to know each other and are especially good when dedicated to specific areas of interest.Similar People:We also make recommendations based on the actions of people similar to you. Similar in this context can mean a variety of things.Similar metadata values (e.g. services interested, product categories interested, etc).Similar sessions added to schedule / attendedHave shown similar interest preferences - e.g. made similar swipes on other users/products etc.In all cases, we can use these similar people and by using any sessions they have added to their agendas we can make recommendations for the user of interest.As a final addition:We have recently decided to add a final ‚Äòbackfill‚Äô to the session recommendations. Previously despite all of the above, some users received no recommendations, while it was also possible for some sessions to not be recommended to anyone. To reduce these occurrences, we now say that if a user has no recommendations they are given a single session as a recommendation (if available), with a preference for sessions rarely or never recommended previously.FAQAre companies/sponsors recommended as well?Currently no, though there are plans to take sessions & session recommendations more into account for profile recommendations in the near future.Can I choose which strategy makes recommendations to my event's participants?No - the various AI routines listed above are chosen by.... AI!Remember that each participant is different and some recommendation strategies will be more or less suited to a given person in a given event. This is why Grip is valuable - these decisions can be made quickly and automatically on a personal basis, based on feedback from each participant skipping or adding sessions to their Schedules.What is the difference between similar sessions and recommendations?Quite simply, recommendations are based on your interactions within the event platform whereas similar sessions arebased on session tags. If a session has no tags it won‚Äôt have similar sessions.

Title: Managing event emails via Grip Dashboard

Content:
Managing event emails via Grip DashboardIn this article, we will give you an overview of the Emails page, and outline how you can use the Email feature within the Grip Dashboard.Grip email consists ofCampaign EmailsAutomated EmailsCampaign emailsare completely customizable, and are created by the Event Organizer in order to be sent out to users once the platform is configured and launched.Automated emailsare sent out based on an attendee's actions or situation within an event. For example, reminding an inactive user to access their profile or listing attendees who have been showing interest in your profile. Other automated emails are sent for meeting request updates, or when a session has been added to a participant‚Äôs schedule and that session is about to begin.In this article, we will cover:Campaign emailsAutomated emailsEmail logsThe email logs tableEmail ActionsUsing the email logs tableOrganizer email settingsChat message emailsEmail securitySSO email differencesUnsubscribesSpam guidelinesFAQsCampaign EmailsA campaign is a customizable email that you can send to as many participants in your event as you like. The most common usage at Grip is for a ‚Äòwelcome email‚Äô - which is usually the first email that your participants receive and contains their initial credentials and a link to log in to the event. However, with our email designer, you can create emails for any purpose you like!To access the Campaign emails on the Dashboard, click on Engage -> Emails.Campaign emails have their own dedicated article as they‚Äôre very powerful - seehere.Automated EmailsAutomated emails are sent to an individual for actions such as meeting requests; meeting reminders; session reminders; chat messages or password reset emails.To access the Automated emails on the Dashboard, click onEngage -> Emails.Email statistics for the automated emails are available on this page and are exportable (note that these statistics are separate from those of Campaign emails). Here you will see your processed, delivered, opened, and clicked emails, along with the total number of unsubscribes, the email open rate, and the bounce rate. Check the tooltips for an explanation of what these refer to.Below that is a table displaying all of the available Automated Emails, along with their individual metrics, controls for turning certain emails off and on, and an option to preview them.Automated emails are split into three different types:'Meeting Emails'. These are, quite obviously, emails to do with meeting interactions within events - each has a description to explain its usage. If the toggle beside an email is enabled, event participants will receive that type of email notification.'Engagement Emails'. Like meeting emails, engagement emails are sent to participants within the platform based on their engagement in the event, as explained in the email descriptions.‚ÄòTeams Emails‚Äô: These are also engagement emails, but triggered via actions from the Teams portal. Some cannot be disabled as they are crucial to functionality, like invite notifications.‚ÄòSystem Emails'. Unlike meeting emails & engagement emails, these emails cannot be enabled/disabled. These essential emails are sent based on the event participants‚Äô actions regarding their login/credentials updates or changes.Email LogsThe email logs page is a great way to interrogate our email system in order to see specific information about an email‚Äôs journey or attendees‚Äô engagement. You can see information about any emails sent from this event, whether they are Automated or Campaign emails.Please note:Grip is limited by the information from our email provider that we have access to. This results in some restrictions on the way that data can be viewed and exported.The email logs tableOn the Logs tab, you can see a table, which when loaded will pull the most recent data from the email system. There are six columns:NameDescriptionNotesEmail AddressThe email address of the recipient to whom we attempted to send the email.DateThe date that the log action was createdTimeThe time that the log action was createdEmail NameThe name of the email that the action relates toThis includes the Automated Emails as well as any Email Campaigns created within the eventActionThe type of action that was recordedSee below for a list of ActionsAction DetailsAny available further details about the actionFor ‚ÄòClicked‚Äô we can see the exact URL that was clicked.For ‚ÄòBounced‚Äô we can see the reason given for a bounced (failed to deliver) emailActionsNameDescriptionAcceptedThe email system accepted the request to send/forward the email and the message has been placed in a queue.DeliveredWe sent the email and it was accepted by the recipient email server.BouncedThe email failed to be delivered to the recipient. This could be for a number of reasons and could be temporary or permanent. For example, an email can bounce due to a full inbox, and then be successfully delivered later.OpenedThe email recipient opened the email and enabled image viewing.ClickedThe email recipient clicked on a link in the email. We can also see the URL that was clicked.UnsubscribedThe email recipient clicked on the unsubscribe link within a sent email.Using the email logs tableYou can browse the actions that are recorded, or use the column filters to narrow down the results. We can display up to 300 rows per page, and you can use the buttons below the table to move to another page if one is available.You can also export the available information that is being displayed by clicking the ‚ÄòExport current page‚Äô button.Please note:due to limitations in the data that we can retrieve from our email supplier, you can only export the current page of data that you‚Äôre looking at. Be sure to check whether other pages of data are available if you‚Äôre looking for a large range of data.Example 1: You want to check whether a particular person received a particular email. To do this you would:Filter the ‚ÄòEmail Address‚Äô to a specific attendee‚Äôs emailFilter the ‚ÄòActions‚Äô column by ‚ÄòDelivered‚ÄôFilter the ‚ÄòEmail Name‚Äô by the name of the email that you‚Äôre concerned withExample 2: You want to export which event attendees have unsubscribed. To do this you would:Filter the ‚ÄòActions‚Äô column by ‚ÄòUnsubscribed‚ÄôExport using the ‚ÄòExport current page‚Äô buttonCheck whether there is another page of available data using the < > buttons below the table.Export any other available pages of data.You can also see which email caused the attendee to unsubscribe by checking the ‚ÄòEmail Name‚Äô column.LimitationsAs we are retrieving external email information, there are some limitations to the functionality of this page. This is unfortunately not something that Grip can control.Data over 30 days old is unavailable.Data under 15 minutes old is not viewable (though of course will be later).Filters must contain complete values - so for example, you cannot search for part of an email address.While you can combine filters, most filters are single-select - so for example, you cannot filter by ‚ÄòDelivered‚Äô and ‚ÄòOpened‚Äô actions at the same time.You can only export the current page of data.We do not know the total number of returned results, so be sure to check whether there are more pages of results.We can only retrieve 300 results per page.You can only use the Time filter if you‚Äôre also filtering by Date. You can however use the Date filter by itself.Anonymous userswill not receive any emails,they can only opt for notifications, since their IDs are not created as they log into the event without registering.Organiser Email SettingsUnder the settings tab, you will see and be able to modify your Email Domain and Support Email Address. (Please note, each time you change the email domain the email stats will rest and reflect the inserted domain data)You will also see the ‚ÄòEnable Emails in this Event‚Äô toggle (Please note, even when disabled, essential system emails like Password resets and Grip Teams invitations will continue to function).Chat Message EmailsThe below grid shows when we send emails to participants about Chat messages they‚Äôve received in an event. As you can see, they are only sent if the recipient is on the web platform and has not used the mobile app, due to the fact that mobile app users are expected to receive notifications on their mobile devices directly.The sender of the message is using:Recipient Has Used Web BeforeUsed iOS BeforeUsed Android BeforeSend Email Chat:WebYesNoNoYesWebIrrelevantYesNoNoWebIrrelevantYesYesNoWebIrrelevantNoYesNoiOS or AndroidIrrelevantIrrelevantIrrelevantNoEmail SecuritySome actions around meetings can be taken inside emails without logging into the platform, in order to provide a seamless user experience. The only actions that can be taken are the ability to Accept or Decline a Pending Meeting. This means that if a participant forwards a ‚ÄúMeeting Requested‚Äù email that they personally received to someone else, the recipient of that email would be able to accept or decline the meeting on the participant‚Äôs behalf.Beyond this specific user experience improvement, no actions can be taken without the user being logged into the platform.SSO Email DifferencesFor Single Sign-On applications, there are two differences with emails:No pre-population of Emails and Badge IDs. This is to make sure that any sensitive information that might be stored in the BadgeID field is not exposed to end users.No Message and View buttons on emails.This is in line with the above change, due to being unable to pre-populate the information for seamless viewing and messaging in meetings, we've also hidden the View/Message buttons in meeting request emails.UnsubscribesWhen an attendee unsubscribes from an email at Grip, they unsubscribe from that particular category of email,within that specific event. There are several fixed categories of email at Grip:Campaign (sent by the Organizer via the dashboard)Meeting (automated emails regarding meeting invites)Engagement (all other automated emails regarding participant activity)System (transactional emails like password resets)For the next event at Grip the attendee is registered to, they will receive all types of emails unless they unsubscribe again.To re-subscribe an attendee to an email category in an event, speak to one of the Grip team who will be able to manage this request with our email supplier. You should expect to provide some sort of evidence that the attendee themselves has requested to be re-subscribed.Spam GuidelinesEmail providers are consistently tightening their rules about what they consider spam. Due to this, it‚Äôs difficult to provide guidelines that work in all scenarios, as many email providers react differently to either the content or the sender domain too. Some emails will go to the spam folder in Hotmail but not to Gmail.In general, note the following points, and try to find content guidelines for specific providers to be sure about what you‚Äôre sending, likethis one from Google.For best results, use an email domain that has a good reputation already. Grip‚Äôs default domain has a good reputation but this can often vary, so if you‚Äôre finding emails going to spam for your attendees, consider using your own custom domain.Try not to send too many emails! The more marketing or non-essential emails you send, the more likely it is that your attendees will unsubscribe or start to mark emails as spam.Make sure that the purpose of each email is very clear, and try to keep each email‚Äôs purpose separate, avoiding mixed messages.Clean up your sending/attendee list regularly and check bounced addresses to ensure that you are only sending to the right people.Advise your attendees to add the sender's email addresses as a sender in the email client. For example, the default sending address for Grip is ‚Äúnoreply@mg.gripcontact.com‚Äù. The equivalent for a custom domain would be ‚Äúnoreply@your.custom.domain‚Äù.Our partner Mailgun has a greatarticle on this subject here- of particular note is the suggestion to avoid trigger phrases used in ads - for example, ‚ÄúAct now‚Äù.FAQHow often should attendees receive the 'People are showing interest in you' automated email?This email is triggered by 'interest' actions on your profile. We don't want to swamp attendees with emails though, so there is a sliding scale based on interaction.For active attendees (those who have logged in to the current event at least once), we send this email when they receive the following numbers of interests: 1, 5, 15, 25.For inactive users (those who haven't yet logged into the current event), we send slightly more frequent emails, to encourage engagement: 1, 3, 8, 15, 25.Is it possible for recipients to send replies to emails they have received from the event?No. Emails sent from our Dashboard must always follow the format of noreply@[emaildomainhere].com. Participants will receive an "undeliverable" auto-response if they attempt to reply. With this in mind, there are a few alternatives if you feel this would be a poor attendee experience. Should you want to utilize the Campaign Emails within the Grip Organizer Dashboard, you can opt to include visually obvious copy, a button, or hyperlink in the email that directs participants to a functional inbox address for replies or queries. Alternatively, you could utilize your existing external email marketing tool. To send a welcome email from your own email marketing provider, you only need to include the Smart Marketing Link in any email from your marketing system as a button, hyperlink, etc to direct participants to the event platform. You can even utilize a pre-populated URL in your external welcome email to assist participants with simplifying their initial login. Learn more about pre-populating login credentialshere.

Title: How Do I Set Up and Use Push Notifications?

URL: https://support.grip.events/how-to-send-a-notification

Content:
How Do I Set Up and Use Push Notifications?Take control of messaging at your eventNotifications allow you to directly message your event attendees in real time. Learning how to create, manage and analyse notifications in the Grip Dashboard is important for maximising event success.For more details on why or how to use notifications in your event,see this article.In this article, we will cover:How to Create a Push NotificationHow to edit and view a Push NotificationPush Notification analyticsFAQsHow to Create a Push NotificationStep 1:Navigate to the'Engage'tab on the dashboard, then select'Notifications'from the dropdown menu, and choose'Push Notifications.'Step 2:On the Push Notifications page, click on 'Create notification' at the top right.Step 3:You will arrive at the 'Segment audience' page. There is a large list of options for segmenting recipients, and the ability to add multiple segments on top of each other. When adding more than one filter, be aware that these are always added on top of one another, so that the total number of recipients will always go down as you add more filters.Some segments allow you to target simple properties about your participants, like which data types they're in. Other segments are based on the actions that your participants have (or have not taken) in the current event, which can allow you to be really creative and refine your recipients. If you do not add any filters, you will be sending the notification to everyone in your event!Data can take a little time to be processed so there will always be a slight delay from a user taking an action and it being available to segment by. Always sense-check the estimated segment size before sending!Note on browser cookiesLegally, tracking attendee actions requires that the attendee accepts performance cookies when visiting the event in a web browser. Be aware of this, as your notifications maynotbe sent to attendees thatdidtake the action(s) in reality but didn't accept cookies initially. This applies in reverse if you're using a segment with a 'fewer than' condition - this could include attendees thatdidtake the action, but that didn't accept cookies and so weren't tracked. Actions taken on the mobile app are always tracked.Note that the 'operator' (e.g. 'Equals', 'Greater than' etc.) is specific to the segment chosen.

Click the flag next to the text box to provide the required translation.Can I disable the default 'Complete your Profile' web notification?Yes, this notification can be disabled. Please consult with your delivery manager. Navigate to 'App Settings' > 'App Configuration & Special Actions' > 'Notifications' and switch off the 'Send complete your profile' toggle.Can I add an Emoji to a notification?Yes, Emojis are supported in Push Notifications.Why is the number of processed notifications lower than the segment size for a Push Notification I sent?This is likely due to users who have not yet opted into notifications within the mobile app. They haven't been prompted to accept them, usually because they haven't visited the notifications section of their mobile app yet.Is there a character limit for Push Notifications?There is no strict character limit for Push Notifications. However, it is recommended to keep the message length between 150-250 characters. This ensures that most of the message is visible on a phone's screen and the various notification lists, though visibility may vary depending on the device, font size, and phone settings.

Title: How does the Grip Smart Marketing Link work?

URL: https://support.grip.events/how-does-the-grip-smart-marketing-link-work

Content:
How does the Grip Smart Marketing Link work?Making sure event participants get where they need to goThe Grip smart marketing link is a simple but powerful feature that enables an organiser to provide a smooth user experience to event participants looking to access the Grip platform. This article explains how Smart Marketing Links work.Why do I need a Smart Link?We want to make sure that event participants are directed to the right destination when they open a link to your event within an email, on your website or any of the other locations a link to the Grip platform might be communicated. For example, when an event participant is on their desktop computer and follows the link in a welcome email, we want it to open the web platform. However when it is pressed on an Android phone we want it to open the Google Play Store or the existing installed app on the participant's cellphone.The Smart Marketing Link is a dynamic route to your event that is automatically configured when you create an event. Its purpose is twofold:Ensure that mobile users are directed to the mobile app instead of the web platform (if your Grip application includes a mobile app).Ensure that desktop users are directed to the correct custom domain on the web (if your event is using a custom domain).Even if you haven't purchased a mobile app or custom domain for your Grip events, Smart Marketing Links will be created, though in this case they will always lead your participants to your event's fixed URL.How do smart links work?Grip uses a service calledBranch.ioto power its smart linking system. This saves us time and increases the stability of the service. For event organisers, it means that we can provide an improved service with a higher level of customization.Smart linking works as follows:What do I need to do as an Event Organiser?Initially you just need to speak to your Grip contacts when you start working with us regarding what you've purchased and what you want to happen - specifically regarding your Custom Domain for web and your Mobile Apps.If you're not using either of these for any of your events, you don't need to do anything.Email LinksThe standard email templates in Campaign emails contain the Smart Marketing Link to your event by default, and the same is true for any Automated emails that your participants receive. If you are creating a link within a campaign email yourself, just make sure to use the 'special links' dropdown for the link to make sure it's using the proper Smart Marketing Link.Mobile AppsOnce your mobile app has been released on the Play and App stores, your Grip contact will update your Smart Marketing Link for your entire Grip application, so that by default all mobile users are directed to the appropriate app. Once this is done, just make sure that your event has 'Mobile' selected as an option underEvent Details > Event Setup > Platforms:This is also how you might disable mobile routing for a single event. If you remove Mobile from the platforms field for a given event, that will modify the Smart Marketing Link to only point to the web URL, so all users will be directed there, even if they have the app installed.Custom DomainsOnce yourcustom domainhas been set up and tested, you can add this to the Smart Marketing Link for any events where you'd like to use it.To do this, again visitEvent Details > Event Setupand this time click on the edit button (pencil icon) next to the Smart Marketing Link.In the dialogue that opens, you can modify the Desktop link, and replace Grip's default domain (matchmaking.grip.events) with your own custom domain.You should end up with something like "https://your.custom.domain/YourEventName".Hit Save changes, then you can test the link by clicking on it in directly in the dashboard or by following a login link in a welcome email.I already sent out my emails but now I need to edit the link!Anyone that follows the link will be redirected according to its current settings. So if you've made a change to the Desktop link URL, or added a mobile app to your event, anyone that clicks on the Smart Marketing Link in your welcome emails will be redirected according to your current settings,even if you sent the emails out previously.The only thing you cannot change is the URL of the Smart Marketing Link itself - although this shouldn't need to be changed, because as you can see, you have control over where it leads.My event isn't ready yet and I've accidentally sent out emails to my participants!In this scenario you can use the Smart Marketing Link to your advantage, and redirect your users away from the event to another website instead - for example a page on your website explaining that the event is not Live yet.To do this, first remove Mobile fromEvent Details > Event Setup > Platformsso that all participants are directed to the Desktop URL (if applicable). Then edit the Smart Marketing Link and change the Desktop URL to wherever you want to take them - even if it's away from Grip completely!Later, once you're ready to start directing participants back to the login page, re-enable Mobile (if applicable), copy the direct eventURLwhich sits just above the Smart Marketing Link, and then change the Desktop link again to route to that instead. Just make sure to add your Custom Domain to the URL again (as above), if you're using one.

Title: Troubleshooting For Email Subdomain

URL: https://support.grip.events/troubleshooting-for-email-subdomain

Content:
Troubleshooting For Email SubdomainWhy Do I Need to Verify My Domain?Mailgun requires domain verification for two primary reasons. First, it confirms that you are the owner of the domain, preventing unauthorized senders from using your domain in our platform. Second, the SPF and DKIM records authorize our SMTP servers to send on behalf of your domain. This serves to significantly improve your deliverability - our specialty!DNS records can be a bit tricky, but if you know a few tips, you can greatly enhance your success with the process. Let‚Äôs take a look at some common issues seen when attempting to verify your domain.I Created My Records, but Mailgun Does Not See Them.You always want to double-check any changes you make to your DNS configuration via both a local and a public query. Local queries can be performed using built-in utilities like dig (Linux/Unix) and nslookup (Windows).To verify via a dig command,¬†the syntax is: dig -t <record type> <hostname>To verify via nslookup,the syntax is: nslookup -q=<record type> <hostname>In some cases, there might be a local DNS server within your network that will take precedence over public queries. Even if you don‚Äôt have a local DNS server, we recommend performing a secondary public query for your domain. One great tool is What‚Äôs My DNS -https://www.whatsmydns.net/. What‚Äôs My DNS will query multiple servers around the globe to best gauge the propagation of your changes.To use, just enter your hostname and select the record type from the options present in the dropdown.If the correct value is returned -¬†congratulations! The record was successfully created.If you do not see the correct value (or see all red X‚Äôs) -¬†something's¬†not quite right yet. Make sure to double-check your configuration and correct your DNS setup as needed.Note:¬†Some DNS provider's panels¬†will¬†automatically append the root domain namefollowing whatever's placed in the¬†hostname value; for instance, if your domain is mail.example.com, you might only need "mail" in the hostname field, or you could be creating a record for mail.example.com.example.com by accident. To help ensure productive use of your time, reach out to your DNS provider to find out how their panel operates.The DKIM Record Is Verified, but the SPF Is NotIt takes two TXT records to verify your domain; SPF and DKIM. If everything looks good with your DKIM record, but not with your SPF, here are a few elements to check:There can only be 1 SPF record per hostname. If your hostname has more than 1 SPF record, the records will need to be merged into a single value.In this case, the issue is occurring due to the separation of the values into two separate entries. The fix is simple - just combine them. You can place the Mailgun include directive (include:mailgun.org) anywhere after¬†v=spf1¬†and before¬†~all. The new value would be:v=spf1 ip4:1.2.3.4 include:smtp.domain.tld include:mailgun.org ~allNote: Make sure that your SPF record doesn't exceed 10 lookups, or you'll run into issues.If the hostname has a CNAME in addition to any other record type (i.e. TXT, A, etc), the CNAME will take precedence.To resolve this and verify the TXT, the CNAME would need to be removed from the hostname. Alternatively, another sending subdomain would need to be used with the Mailgun account, such as (for this example) mg.domain.tld.The Records Are Resolving, but Mailgun Still Says That the Domain Is ‚ÄúUnverified‚ÄùDepending on the DNS hosting provider, records can take up to 24-48 hours to fully propagate. A manual verification can be attempted if 24 hours have already passed and the records are confirmed correct via both local and public queries.To perform a manual verification and update the DNS records cache, log into your Mailgun control panel. If you're using our classic UI (options across the top, with a silver background) you can follow these instructions:Click¬†DomainsSelect your¬†domain's nameUnder¬†Domain Verification & DNS¬†select¬†Check DNS Records Now.If you're using our beta UI (options displayed down the left-hand side on a dark column):Click¬†Messages.Select your¬†specific¬†domain.Click¬†Settings.Select¬†DNS Records.Click the green¬†Check DNS Records Now¬†button.Other DNS Records - OptionalWhile the two TXT records (SPF and DKIM) are all that's required to send messages via Mailgun, you do also have the¬†option¬†to add¬†MX¬†and¬†CNAMErecords, if you choose.¬†The process for adding these optional records is exactly the same as adding the required TXT records.MX¬†records are really only needed if you're looking to¬†receive incoming mail¬†for the¬†exact domain¬†or¬†domains¬†you have verified in your Mailgun account;¬†keep in mind - you don't want to point your domain's MX records to Mailgun if you already have incoming mail setup elsewhere. If you do,¬†adding Mailgun MX records will break this configuration, and you won't receive your mail as you have previously.Note: You¬†only¬†ever want to have¬†one source specified for your MX records, otherwise servers get confused. Bad things happen when servers get confused.A¬†CNAME¬†record is needed only if you're looking to enable our¬†tracking features, keeping detailed records of¬†Clicks,¬†Opens, and/or¬†Unsubscribes.If you are still experiencing any issues after the domain's DNS records are publicly resolving, just reach out to our Support team via the¬†Support¬†tab in your Mailgun control panel!Which Method Works Best for You?To get your sending off the ground, after you've got yourdomain addedandfully configured, you need to decide¬†which¬†of our¬†two methods¬†you're going to use;¬†SMTP¬†or¬†API. You'll be using¬†one of the two methods¬†to send via our platform using a¬†sending application¬†of your choice.Both methods work very well - it's all about what¬†your use case¬†needs¬†happen to be, as well as¬†your personal preferences. At a glance:SMTP:Flexible with existing applicationsLess technical/coding knowledge not necessaryOpen protocolAPI:Faster (three times faster!)More technical/coding knowledge necessary;No need to craft a¬†MIME¬†(message body) -¬†we assemble it¬†on our side!Better for¬†large scale¬†sending; more volume, to more recipients, with less effortHow Do We Put This Into Practice?Here's a¬†snapshot¬†of¬†sending via Mailgun¬†with our¬†API:Have your¬†API key¬†ready, found in your Mailgun control panel. Need help?Look here.Your¬†API base url¬†will behttps://api.mailgun.net/v3/YOUR_DOMAIN/Check out ourlibrariesfor easy integration with Python, Ruby, Java, C# and PHPHere's sample code for sending an email with cURL:Clicking on links in Grip emails throws a privacy error in Chrome browserThis is because your top level domain has a Strict-Transport-Security policy that includes all subdomains. At Grip, we use a sub domain for email tracking of clicks and opens only work over HTTP and not HTTPS. Because the top level domain now has instructions that all subdomains only be accessed using HTTPS, clicking in Grip emails throws an error because clicks are tracked through the subdomain that only works using HTTP.To support click tracking, please disable HSTS for all subdomains by removing "includeSubDomains" from your web server for your top level domain website.

Title: How do notifications work at Grip?

URL: https://support.grip.events/push-notifications

Content:
How do notifications work at Grip?This article covers how notifications (such as push notifications and silent notifications) work on the Grip platformAs an event organizer, notifications empower you to send messages, whether in the form of text or links, to all event participants. These messages can direct participants to their profiles, company profiles, product or item details, specific sessions or even external links. Additionally, these notifications can be transmitted in multiple languages.In this article, we will cover:What is the difference between Push and Silent Notifications?What should I use Notifications for?How to create notificationsFAQsWhat is the difference between Push and Silent Notifications?The distinction between a Push Notification and a Silent Notification lies in their visibility and behavior. Push Notifications are interactive pop-up messages that display on a participant's mobile device, even if the device is locked. These notifications also appear while the participant is using other applications on their device and in the notification centres within the event platform, accessible on both the web and mobile.Silent notifications are much more passive, shown only in the notification centres, and so are useful for conveying messages that aren't time-sensitive.Push Notification:Displays on a participant's mobile device, even when the device is locked.Appears while the participant is using another application.Available in the participant's notifications center within the event platform on both web and mobile.On web, push notifications come through to the user's computer as a notification from their browser software, similar to what happens with online email platforms.Silent Notification:Appears only in the participant's notifications center within the event platform on both web and mobile.Does not trigger any external or device-level alerts, such as pop-up messages or sounds.What can Push Notifications be used for?Push Notifications are versatile and can be utilized in several ways:Promoting Immediate Action:Push Notifications encourage users to take prompt actions, such as viewing a profile, attending a session, responding to pending meetings or filling out an external feedback form.Re-engagement:These notifications are effective in re-engaging users who are not currently active on your platform. Sending relevant and enticing notifications can bring them back to the event.Sponsorship:Push Notifications can be used as a sponsorship tool. Collaborate with sponsors to send targeted messages to specific audience segments, enhancing the visibility of sponsor content.Audience Segmentation:Intelligent audience segmentation allows you to target specific groups of users with tailored messages, ensuring that they receive content relevant to their interests and preferences.Key considerations when using Push Notifications:Target Audience:Define the specific audience you wish to reach with your Push Notification.Content:Craft compelling and relevant content that captures attention and prompts action.Delivery Type:Choose the appropriate type of Push Notification, such as text or links, based on your message's purpose.Timing:Timing is crucial. Send notifications at optimal moments to maximize impact, considering the user's time zone and preferences.What can Silent Notifications be used for?Silent notifications are not as highly used, but have an important place in event communication.Prevent distraction:As there is no pop-up or immediate prompt for a silent notification, they are less distracting for your event participants. Event days are busy, and too many notifications can be annoying for your attendees, leading to them ignoring or disabling notifications entirely.Lower-priority communication:Consider using silent notifications for messages that don't require immediate action for your attendees. General event notices, thank you's or shoutouts are good examples of this.How to Create NotificationsTo create, edit, manage and measure notifications in the Grip dashboard,see this article.FAQsAre Push Notifications multi-language?Yes. If your Grip application supports multiple languages, attendees will receive the notification in the language that's set as their 'User preferred language'. This language can be set per attendee via theinitial data load(i.e. via registration). It is also updated if the attendee is using the web platform and chooses to change to a different language.Can I disable the default 'Complete your Profile' web notification?Yes, you can disable this notification. To do so, please consult with your delivery manager about this decision. Simply navigate to 'App Settings' > 'App Configuration & Special Actions' > 'Notifications' and switch off the toggle 'Send complete your profile'.Can I add Emojis to a push notification?Yes!

Instead of your event participants seeing a separate Grip link likehttps://matchmaking.grip.events, they'll see a link that fits right into your website, likehttps://subdomain.yourdomain.com.Custom Domain FormatThe current format of the Grip networking platform URL is:https://matchmaking.grip.events/<your event system name>You can choose your domain name instead of "matchmaking.grip.events" and follow the steps under the 'How to set up your custom domain' section in the article.Please note that the <your event system name>, which corresponds to the 'System name' in Event Details > Event Setup on the Grip Dashboard, is fixed and cannot be changed.How to set up your custom domainTo set up your custom domain, follow these steps:Step 1: Choose Your SubdomainDecide on the subdomain name you want to use.Step 2: Create CNAME RecordContact your domain host and create a DNS CNAME record with the following details:Value: matchmaking02.grip.eventsTTL: 300Step 3: Verify CNAME Record ConfigurationOnce you've set up the CNAME record with your domain host, you can use theGoogle Admin Toolboxto check if the setup in Step 2 was successful.If the DNS CNAME record is not in place, you won't be able to proceed with setting up the Grip Dashboard. Make sure it's configured correctly before moving forward.Step 4: Grip Team Adds Custom Domain on Grip Dashboardüí° Once you've set up the CNAME Record, you'll require a Grip Team member to add, update, or remove custom URL subdomains on the Grip Dashboard.Click on "App Settings" > "App Management" > "Custom Domains."Enter your desired subdomain (e.g.,subdomain.yourdomain.com).Choose the 'Default Event Redirect' option to specify which event should open when using the custom subdomain URL.Save your changes.Note: These changes will take effect every working day from 10 am GMT time, following a human review for safety.Step 5: Update your Smart Marketing Links to point to your new domainOnce your custom domain is set up and ready to go, you'll want to start directing your event participants to it. Here's how you can update your Smart Marketing Links:Go to the Grip Dashboard.Navigate to Event Details/Event Setup/Smart Marketing Link section.Edit the smart marketing link and update the 'Desktop link' field to point to your custom domain.Save your changes.For more detailed instructions, check out ourSmart Marketing Link article, specifically the steps under 'Custom Domains'.Step 6: Verify Your Subdomain URLAfter setting up your custom subdomain URL, open it in your web browser. You should be automatically redirected to your event page.FAQsQ: I want to use the same domain for multiple events inside one application. What do I need to do?A: Firstly, make sure that these events aren't running at the same time. Concurrent events using the same custom URL subdomain are not supported. This is because push notifications cannot be sent to two different events with the same custom URL on the event mobile app.If you wish to use the same domain for events that are running at different times inside one app, repeat step 2 if you want to change your primary event.Q: Can I have multiple custom domains for events within one application?A: Yes, but there are some limitations regarding notifications.Q: Can I use a .cn (Chinese) custom domain?A: At this time, using a .cn (Chinese) custom domain is not possible due to certification constraints. Other custom domains can still be accessed in China, albeit with degraded performance levels.Q: Can I use the same custom subdomain for email and URL?A: No, we currently use a third-party provider to manage email subdomains and our own server to set up custom URLs. Using the same domain for web and email would result in emails being sent to our server, which may not be processed correctly.Q: Can I provide an SSL certificate instead of a Grip-managed one?A: Yes, but it is not recommended due to manual work and potential security issues. If you prefer to do this, please send Grip the SSL private key, certificates, and intermediate certificates for installation on the Grip webservers. The private key must be an RSA key with a size of 2048 bits or lower, in PEM format (Base64 encoded ASCII), and unencrypted. Grip cannot import a private key protected by a password or passphrase.Q: Is it possible for me to verify the existence of a DNS CNAME record for the domain with the value "matchmaking02.grip.events" and a TTL of 300?A: Certainly, you can utilize a tool like Google Admin Toolbox to check the CNAME.https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#CNAME/Q: What exactly is meant by a "third-level subdomain," and how does it relate to setting up custom domain names for easier DNS management?A: For easier DNS management, we suggest using a third-level subdomain name like "matchmaking.yourdomain.com" or "event.yourdomain.com".Q: Can the TTL record be set to 1 hour?A:¬†We strongly recommend a 300 seconds TTL (5 minutes) as it allows any changes we make to be reflected within 5 minutes for the end user. Opting for a longer TTL, such as an hour, means that any modifications we implement will take up to an hour to take effect for your custom domain. This may result in users being unable to access web networking for up to an hour.While we won't accept anything longer than 15 minutes, we are open to proceeding with a 15-minute TTL under the condition that you accept full responsibility for any delays this may cause to users.Q: How does Grip handle SSL certificates for custom domains?A: Grip will generate an SSL certificate for the custom domain using Let's Encrypt. The certificate will be automatically renewed (within 30 days of expiration) as long as the domain points to the Web networking host (matchmaking02.grip.events). You can use an SSL Checker to diagnose problems with your SSL certificate.Q: Is it possible to set up custom domains (email and URL) with the format 'subdomain.subdomain.domain.com'?A: Yes, it is possible to configure custom domains, also known as 4th level domains, in the format 'subdomain.subdomain.domain.com'.Q: Why are users receiving HTTPS errors when clicking links from emails?A:If the browser error message displays the custom web domain, the issue is likely related to the tracking protocol in MailGun. Ensure the tracking protocol is set to HTTPS within MailGun's settings to resolve this error.Q: Why is a participant unable to access the Welcome Email link or event URL, while others can access it without issues?A:If the browser error message contains "matchmaking.grip.events" instead of the custom web domain, the issue is likely with the participant's ISP incorrectly resolving the domain (e.g., a-to-be.com). Advise the participant to contact their ISP or try using a different network to resolve the issue.Q: Will emails sent for our event avoid the spam folder if we use a custom URL domain?A:Yes, using a custom email DNS helps ensure emails are less likely to go to spam because they will appear to come from your organization‚Äôs domain.Q: Should the domain be the same as our company‚Äôs website domain or a completely new one?A:The domain can be any domain your organization owns, as you‚Äôll need to set it up in your hosting provider. The subdomain can be anything you choose, as long as it‚Äôs not already being used elsewhere. Remember: the custom URL subdomain and the custom email DNS subdomain must be different.

How Do I Configure a Custom Email DomainLearn how to set up a custom email domain to maintain brand consistency for your event communications.Configuring a custom email domain on the Grip platform allows you to maintain brand consistency throughout your event communications. Instead of using default email addresses like "noreply@mg.grip.events," you can send emails from an address like "noreply@your.domain.com" (assuming you already own domain.com). This article will guide you through the process of setting up a custom email domain, ensuring your event emails reflect your brand.Table of ContentsWhy Use a Custom Email Domain?Steps to Configure Your Custom Email DomainStep 1: Choose Your Domain NameStep 2: Grip ConfigurationStep 3: DNS Records SetupStep 4: Set the Email Subdomain on the Grip Dashboard and Test ItTroubleshootingFAQsWhy Use a Custom Email Domain?Using a custom email domain for your events provides several benefits:Brand Consistency:Aligns email communications with your brand identity.Increased Trust:Recipients are more likely to trust emails sent from a recognized domain.Improved Engagement:Branded emails can lead to higher open and click-through rates.Steps to Configure Your Custom Email DomainStep 1: Choose Your Domain NameSelect a subdomain in the format "subdomain.yourdomain.com" that will be used for sending event emails. Examples include:"matchmaking.yourdomain.com""connect.yourdomain.com"In the below example, 'connect'is your chosen subdomain and'grip.events'is your existing domain.Note:The prefix "noreply@" will automatically be added to your chosen subdomain for all emails sent from the Grip dashboard.Step 2: Grip ConfigurationProvide your chosen subdomain to the Grip team. They will configure the necessary settings on Mailgun and provide you with the required DNS records (TXT, MX, and CNAME).Caution:Ensure you have access to your domain's DNS records. You may need to collaborate with your IT team or domain provider to implement these changes.Step 3: DNS Records SetupFollow the instructions provided by Mailgun to add the DNS records to your hosting provider. You can refer tothis guidefor detailed steps starting from Step 2.Caution:DNS changes may take 24 to 48 hours to propagate. Grip will notify you once the domain is verified and the configuration is complete. Avoid making any changes to the DNS records after propagation, as this could impact email functionality during your event.Step 4: Set the email subdomain on the Grip dashboard and test itLog in to the Grip Dashboardand navigate to your event.Go to'Engage' > ‚ÄòAutomated Emails‚Äô.Open the‚ÄòSettings'tab.Enter your subdomain into the'Mailgun Domain'field.IMPORTANT:Enter only the subdomain, such as ‚Äúmy.emaildomain.com,‚Äù without the "noreply@" prefix.Ensure that emails are enabled and click'Save'.If successful, the page will refresh, and email statistics will be reset to zero.If an error occurs, there might be a configuration issue with Mailgun. Recheck your setup and contact your Delivery Manager if necessary.Send a test email to yourself. The sender should appear as your configured subdomain.Caution:Changing the email domain in the Grip dashboard resets all current email statistics. Ensure this step is completed before launching your event. If a domain change is necessary after the event has launched, export the existing statistics first, as they will be lost after the change.Step 5: Mailgun setupTo make sure you can track opens and clicks in your email campaigns, you'll need to adjust some settings in your Mailgun account. Here's how:Log in to Mailgun.Go to "Sending" > "Domains".Find the domain you want to use and click on it.Go to "Sending" > "Domain Settings".Find the "Tracking" section.Under "Click Tracking," click "Edit," select "On," and then "Save."Do the same for "Open Tracking."Set the Tracking Protocol to HTTPS.Click "Edit" next to "Tracking Protocol," select "HTTPS," and then "Save."That's it! You've enabled email tracking for your domain.TroubleshootingProblem:Emails are not being sent after configuring the custom domain.Solution:Verify that the DNS records were added correctly. Check with your IT team to ensure there were no errors during the setup process.Problem:The domain verification fails in the Grip Dashboard.Solution:Double-check the DNS records for accuracy. If issues persist, contact Grip support for assistance.FAQsQ: Is it possible to set up custom domains (email and URL) with the format 'subdomain.subdomain.domain.com'?A:Yes, it is possible to configure custom domains, also known as 4th level domains, in the format 'subdomain.subdomain.domain.com'.Q: How long does it take for DNS changes to propagate?A:DNS changes typically take 24 to 48 hours to propagate fully.Q: What happens if I change the domain after my event has started?A:Changing the domain will reset all email statistics. Be sure to export any needed data before making changes.

Title: How do I verify my email subdomain?

URL: https://support.grip.events/how-do-i-verify-my-email-subdomain

How do I verify my email subdomain?Mailgun enforces domain verification for two main reasons. Firstly, it serves as a confirmation that you are the legitimate owner of the domain, preventing unauthorized parties from misusing your domain within our platform. Secondly, the verification of SPF and DKIM records authorizes our SMTP servers to send emails on your domain's behalf, significantly enhancing your email deliverability - which is our specialty!Tips for Domain Verification SuccessSetting up DNS records for domain verification can be a bit tricky, but with a few key tips, you can increase your chances of a successful verification process. Here are some common issues to watch out for when verifying your domain:"I Created My Records, but Mailgun Does Not See Them"Always double-check any changes made to your DNS configuration through both local and public queries. Local queries can be performed using utilities like dig (Linux/Unix) and nslookup (Windows).To verify through a dig command, use the syntax: dig -t TYPE DOMAINTo verify through nslookup, use the syntax: nslookup -q=TYPE DOMAINLocal DNS servers in your network might take precedence over public queries, so even if you don't have a local DNS server, it's recommended to perform a secondary public query for your domain. You can use tools like "What's My DNS" to check the propagation of your changes across multiple global servers."The DKIM Record Is Verified, but the SPF Is Not"To verify your domain, you need two TXT records: SPF and DKIM. If your DKIM record is in order but not the SPF, consider these aspects:There can only be one SPF record per hostname. If your hostname contains multiple SPF records, they should be merged into a single value.The new value should be structured like this: v=spf1 ip4:1.2.3.4 include:smtp.domain.tld include:mailgun.org ~all. Make sure your SPF record doesn't exceed 10 lookups to avoid issues.If your hostname has a CNAME in addition to other record types (e.g., TXT, A), the CNAME will take precedence over other records. You can resolve this by removing the CNAME from the hostname or using a different sending subdomain."The Records Are Resolving, but Mailgun Still Says the Domain Is Unverified"Depending on the DNS hosting provider, records can take up to 24-48 hours to fully propagate. A manual verification can be attempted if 24 hours have already passed and the records are confirmed correct via both local and public queries.To perform a manual verification and update the DNS records cache, log into your Mailgun control panel. If you're using our classic UI (options across the top, with a silver background) you can follow these instructions:Click¬†DomainsSelect your¬†domain's nameUnder¬†Domain Verification & DNS¬†select¬†Check DNS Records Now.If you're using our beta UI (options displayed down the left-hand side on a dark column):Click¬†Messages.Select your¬†specific¬†domain.Click¬†Settings.Select¬†DNS Records.Click the green¬†Check DNS Records Now¬†button.Other DNS Records - OptionalWhile the two TXT records (SPF and DKIM) are all that's required to send messages via Mailgun, you do also have the¬†option¬†to add¬†MX¬†and¬†CNAMErecords, if you choose.¬†The process for adding these optional records is exactly the same as adding the required TXT records.MX¬†records are really only needed if you're looking to¬†receive incoming mail¬†for the¬†exact domain¬†or¬†domains¬†you have verified in your Mailgun account;¬†keep in mind - you don't want to point your domain's MX records to Mailgun if you already have incoming mail setup elsewhere. If you do,¬†adding Mailgun MX records will break this configuration, and you won't receive your mail as you have previously.Note: You¬†only¬†ever want to have¬†one source specified for your MX records, otherwise servers get confused. Bad things happen when servers get confused.A¬†CNAME¬†record is needed only if you're looking to enable our¬†tracking features, keeping detailed records of¬†Clicks,¬†Opens, and/or¬†Unsubscribes.If you are still experiencing any issues after the domain's DNS records are publicly resolving, just reach out to our Support team via the¬†Support¬†tab in your Mailgun control panel!Which Method Works Best for You?To get your sending off the ground, after you've got yourdomain addedandfully configured, you need to decide¬†which¬†of our¬†two methods¬†you're going to use;¬†SMTP¬†or¬†API. You'll be using¬†one of the two methods¬†to send via our platform using a¬†sending application¬†of your choice.Both methods work very well - it's all about what¬†your use case¬†needs¬†happen to be, as well as¬†your personal preferences.

How Do I Set Up and Manage Email Campaigns?Learn how to create and manage customizable email campaigns for your event participants using Grip‚Äôs powerful tools.A campaign is a customizable email that you can send to all of your event participants. The most common usage at Grip is for a ‚Äòwelcome email‚Äô, which is usually the first email that your participants receive, and contains their initial credentials and a link to log in to the event. However with our email designer, you can create emails for any purpose you like.A fair use limit applies to our campaign emails - please refer to ourterms of servicefor more detail.In this article we‚Äôll go through how you can set up and manage your campaigns, using tools like segmentation, scheduling and AutoSending, along with how to see email analytics and judge your campaigns‚Äô effectiveness.Table of ContentsStatisticsCampaign ListRegistration AutoSendingCreating your first CampaignUnsubscribe LinksCopying EventsDeactivating EventsFAQsStatisticsWhen you navigate to theEngage > Emailssection and select theCampaignstab, the first thing you'll see is the email statistics for all existing campaigns. These statistics provide a snapshot of your campaigns' engagement levels, helping you gauge their effectiveness. Hover over the ‚Äòi‚Äô tooltips next to each number for detailed explanations.Detailed Logs:For more comprehensive information on sent emails, or to export a list of bounced or unsubscribed addresses, use theLogstab.Exportable Data:All campaign statistics can be exported by clicking the ‚ÄòExport as CSV‚Äô button.Real-Time Updates:Statistics are not updated in real-time; allow a few minutes and refresh the page to view the latest numbers.The Campaign ListIf you haven‚Äôt created a campaign yet, you‚Äôll see a prompt to start creating one. Once campaigns are created, a table displays them along with key details such as status and engagement metrics. Hover over the table headers for explanations of each column.Campaign States:Draft:The campaign has not been sent or scheduled.Scheduled:The campaign is set to be sent at a future time.Sent:The campaign has already been sent.For each campaign, you‚Äôll find an overflow menu (three vertical dots) at the end of the row, offering options such as:Edit/Resend:Modify settings or design, and resend the campaign to participants in the segment.Cancel Sending:Cancel a scheduled campaign before it is sent.Delete:Permanently delete the campaign and its associated data.Caution: Campaigns created in the old email editor cannot be edited in the new editor. They will continue to be sent if they were already scheduled or have AutoSending enabled, but you will notice that you cannot edit them, only delete them.Registration AutoSendingRegistration AutoSendingis a feature that automatically sends an email to any newly-registered profile that enters a specific segment. This is particularly useful for ensuring that new participants receive welcome emails or other important communications without manual intervention.Example:If you create a campaign for participants in Group X and enable Registration AutoSending, only new registrants added to Group X will receive the email. Existing participants added manually to Group X will not.Session example:If you use it for the segment option ‚Äòattendees of a session‚Äô. This would mean that any participant that adds a given session to their schedule will receive an email that you‚Äôve created for this purpose, automatically.Note:AutoSending begins only after the initial email campaign is sent, making it safe to enable even for scheduled emails.Creating your first CampaignIf you haven‚Äôt created a campaign yet, click theCreate Campaignbutton below the statistics bar to open the email designer.Steps to Create a Campaign:Campaign Name:Enter a name that is unique and identifiable for future reference. This name will not be visible to recipients.Choose Segment:Define your target audience by selecting a number of filters. There is a large list of options for segmenting recipients, and the ability to add multiple segments on top of each other. When adding more than one filter, be aware that these are always added on top of one another, so that the total number of recipients will always go down as you add more filters.Some segments allow you to target simple properties about your participants, like which data types they're in. Other segments are based on the actions that your participants have (or have not taken) in the current event, which can allow you to be really creative and refine your recipients.Note on browser cookiesLegally, tracking attendee actions requires that the attendee accepts performance cookies when visiting the event in a web browser. Be aware of this, as your notifications may be sent to attendees thatdidtake the action(s) in reality but didn't accept cookies initially. Actions taken on the mobile app are always tracked.If you do not add any filters, you will be sending the email to everyone in your event!Note that the 'operator' (e.g. 'Equals', 'Greater than' etc.) is specific to the segment chosen. In some you may see options for 'Includes one of' or 'Matches all of', which act as a choice between an AND or an OR condition.Examples:Using the 'Viewed Page' filter and selecting both theEvent AgendaandTeams - Inbound Leadspages."Includes one of" - would allow you to send a notification to any participants who have visitedeithertheEvent AgendaorTeams - Inbound Leadspages."Matches all of" - would allow you to limit your notification toonlyparticipants who have visitedboththeEvent AgendaandTeams - Inbound Leadspages.See this table for a full list of segmentation options:SegmentOptionsDescriptionData TypeSelect specific Data TypesSends a notification to specific data types (e.g., Attendees, Exhibitors, Speakers).Custom GroupSelect specific Custom Group(s)Sends a notification to all members of a chosen groups.Status in the eventActive, InactiveSends a notification to either active users (logged in) or inactive users (not yet logged in).Attendees of SessionSelect a session(s)Sends a notification to participants who have added the session to their schedule.Invitees of Private SessionSelect a private session(s)Sends a notification to invitees of a private session (those invited but not yet added).Attendees of Sessions on a TrackSelect a track(s)Sends a notification to participants who have added at least one session on this Track.Attendees of Sessions at a StageSelect a stage(s)Sends a notification to participants who have added at least one session at this Stage.User emailSearch for individual participantsSends a notification to the participants specifically chosen.Last activity withinEnter number of days between 1 - 99If the participant has used the platform via any device in last X days.Has logged in on mobile or webWebiOSAndroidIf the participant has ever used the platform via this device.Viewed PageAll custom Navigation Items in event, plus a list of default pages.Note that some pages are only available on the Web, like Teams.If the participant has visited or clicked on this page on web or mobile.Unique Profiles ViewedNumber between 1 - 99Number of profile pages viewed.Unique Sessions ViewedNumber between 1 - 99Number of session detail pages visited.Added Sessions to ScheduleNumber between 1 - 99Number of sessions added to schedule.Session Feedback givenNumber between 1 - 99Number of times the participant left session feedback.Meeting Feedback givenNumber between 1 - 99Number of times the participant left meeting feedback.Created Meeting RequestsNumber between 1 - 99Number of meeting requests created.Interested actionsNumber between 1 - 99Number of profiles the participant has marked as 'Interested'.Skip actionsNumber between 1 - 99Number of profiles the participant has marked as 'Skip'.MustMeet ‚ÄòMeet‚Äô preferences madeNumber between 1 - 99Number of profiles the participant has marked as 'Meet'.MustMeet ‚ÄòMustMeet‚Äô preferences madeNumber between 1 - 99Number of profiles the participant has marked as 'MustMeet'.MustMeet ‚ÄòNo thanks‚Äô preferences madeNumber between 1 - 99Number of profiles the participant has marked as 'No thanks'.Pending MeetingsNumber between 1 - 99Current number of meetings sent by a participant that are Pending.Meetings Awaiting ResponseNumber between 1 - 99Current number of meetings sent by a participant that are Awaiting Response.Accepted MeetingsNumber between 1 - 99Current number of meetings the participant has Accepted.Declined MeetingsNumber between 1 - 99Current number of meetings the participant has Declined.Created ConnectionsNumber between 1 - 99Current number of Connections in this event.Interested Swipes not AnsweredNumber between 1 - 99Number of profiles that have shown Interest, where the participant has not responded.Recommendation AnswersNumber between 1 - 99Number of recommendations the participant has responded to (accepted or declined).Badge Scans MadeNumber between 1 - 99Number of unique badge scans this participant has made.Badge Scans ReceivedNumber between 1 - 99Number of unique badge scans this participant has received.Has been scanned into X sessionList of sessionsIf the participant has been scanned into sessions.Choose Template:Start with a pre-built template or create a custom design from scratch. Every template includes a mandatory unsubscribe link that should not be altered.You will only see this step when you first create a campaign. When editing an existing campaign, you will have already picked a template and so have a design which you can continue to edit.Template NameDescriptionSession_InviteA design geared towards encouraging participants to add a session to their schedule.Welcome_LongA welcome email containing credentials that the recipient can use to log in, along with some additional instruction and detail about what to expect.Welcome_ShortA simplified email containing credentials and less detail.Edit Design:Use the drag-and-drop editor to customize your email. Add buttons, images, and merge tags to personalize content. Ensure that all event-specific links and merge tags are correctly applied (see section below regarding links).For a quick rundown on features, you canwatch this video on YouTube.Multi-Language Designs:If your event supports multiple languages, you can create different language variants of the email design.Test and Send:Preview the email design on different devices, set an engaging subject line, and send a test email to verify everything is working as expected. Be aware that in multi-language appplications, you'll be forced to add a subject line in each available language, to avoid accidents. Click the language selected in the subject line field to see what's available.Save or Schedule:Save your campaign as a draft or schedule it to be sent at a specific time. You can also enable Registration AutoSending at this stage.Caution:For events that use Single Sign-On instead of the normal Grip login experience, it is advised that youremovethe Registration ID credentials from your welcome emails for security reasons.Often the Registration ID is used as a private key to validate login with an external SSO provider, and so should not be made public in an email like this.Your TemplatesYou can save your email designs as templates for future campaigns, making it easier to maintain consistency and save time across all events within your Grip application. These templates are accessible to dashboard users with the App Admin role or higher. If your Grip application supports multiple languages, your templates can be created in multiple languages as well.Email colors are configured through the branding options of your event. This ensures that your email's call-to-actions (CTAs) are visible and consistent with your brand identity. While automated emails automatically inherit the event‚Äôs primary color, campaign emails require manual setup within the branding options.You‚Äôll have the opportunity to save your email design as a template at the end of the design process. If you‚Äôve already saved templates from previous campaigns, they will be available at this step for reuse.Keep in mind:that when you use one of your saved templates as a starting point for a new campaign, you aren‚Äôt altering the original template. Any new design you create can be saved as a separate template for future use.If you need to delete a template, hover over it during this step and click the trash can icon. Confirm the deletion to remove the template from the Grip application, which will erase it from all events. However, this will not affect any campaign emails already created from that template‚Äîonly the template itself will be deleted.Here are some important things to note for working with emails in Grip:Caution: all text within a mail merge field‚Äôs  must remain as initially written, in English, even for emails being sent in other languages. Translating these tags will prevent the emails from sending.Event-Specific LinksWhen adding a button, menu, image or any other type of object that contains a link, you have the option of adding in any URL. By default we have pre-defined the main login link that all your event participants will use, called the Smart Marketing Link.Smart Marketing LinkThis is the standard link that you should use wherever you invite your attendees to log in to the platform. It is adynamic linkwhich will take your attendees to the web login page or mobile app depending on the device that they use to open the email.If opening on the web, it will alsohelp the email recipient by pre-filling datalike their email address and Registration ID.If you accidentally delete the login button from the email design then you can create another one - in the URL field of the link that you create, just copy in the following text:If you want to direct email recipients to somewhere really specific, and don't want them to be taken to the mobile app, then you can type in your own URL instead of the Smart Marketing Link. An example might be to send an email reminder to Company Representatives to encourage them to create their Teams, which they have to do on the web version of the event platform.The easiest way to do this is to navigate to that page yourself and copy the link in your browser's address bar, which will ensure that if you're using aCustom Domain, you are directing your attendees to the correct site. Alternatively, you can get quite creative withdeep linksif you want to!You could also do this for something like a Session that you want to send an email invite for.Note: Session links are most effective on the web - if you have a mobile app and your recipients click on a Session link via their cellphones, they will simply be taken to the event mobile app itself.Merge TagsMerge tags are an essential part of email design, and we have predefined a list of Grip-specific fields for you to use. These are especially important when it comes to welcome emails, where the login credentials shown are unique and specific to the intended recipient.Whenever you‚Äôre typing text in one of the blocks, you‚Äôll see an option to add a merge tag in the formatting bar - or you can type a curly bracket { to instantly see a drop-down list of tags.The available merge tags refer to fields within the recipient's profile in Grip and are built with two curly brackets }{ surrounding the field. Unfortunately we cannot list them as copyable text in this article because our help center tries to convert them into its own merge tags! We've converted them into pictures so that you can write them out yourself from the table below.FieldMerge TagFirst NameLast NameNameCompany NameEmail AddressRegistration IDEvent NameFor welcome emails, you should always include the Email Address and Registration ID merge tags, so that your attendees have what they need to log in. Refer to the pre-built welcome email templates if you need some guidance on this.It‚Äôs good practice to use merge tags in your templates, so that you don‚Äôt need to change much between events - for example using the ‚ÄòEvent Name‚Äô merge tag instead of writing out the name of the event itself within the design.When using merge tags, make sure you‚Äôre confident that your attendees all have this data in their Grip profiles, otherwise you may end up with empty spaces in the resulting emails!ImagesYou can upload images or just copy and paste a direct image link.If you‚Äôre linking to images, make sure to use publicly-available image links, and ensure that you use a link to the image itself. An easy way to tell if your link is correct is to make sure that it ends in the file format of the image itself, for example ‚Äú.png‚Äù or ‚Äú.jpg‚Äù.Google Drive or Dropbox links will not work, as they do not lead directly to an image, they lead to a google drive page with the image within it.To overlay items on top of an image, add it as the background to an existing column. Otherwise, use an image block if you‚Äôre looking to add an image between other components.PreviewingYou can use the built-in preview tool at the bottom-left to check how responsive your email design is for different screen sizes. This is an important step in order to ensure that your email design looks as intended on a range of desktop and mobile devices.Multi-Language DesignsIn apps where multiple languages have been enabled for your events, you‚Äôll also be able to design email variants for these additional languages. The journey has been designed so that you can complete your English design first (as it is mandatory), before moving on to the additional languages, where your English design is your starting point.Note that your attendees will receive emails (and notifications) in the language that is set on their profile under the ‚ÄòUser Preferred Language‚Äô field. This is set either as part of the data import, and can be modified by the attendee themselves when they‚Äôve logged into the web platform.If you have a multi-language app, you will be prompted about additional languages once you click ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô on the design step. You are given the option to design other variants or just use the English version for all recipients, regardless of their language preference.Email Subject LineNow that you‚Äôve completed your design, make sure you choose an engaging Subject Line that recipients will see in their inboxes. Best practice for subjects is to keep them within 50 characters, although you can technically add up to 130 characters.We support the use of emojis, and you can also use merge tags to personalize your subject lines. You will need to write them in the tag format, so as a reminder,here is the list of merge tags.Example: ‚ÄúStart networking now for!‚ÄùIf your application is multi-language, you must add in a subject line in every language before you can save or send the email (even if you just use an English subject line for all of them).Testing EmailsYou can use this option to fire off a test to some attendees of your choice. Use the search bar to look up profiles within the current event and send the email to the email addresses on their profiles.Again, if you have a multi-language application, you can choose which language design variant to send to the profile - regardless of their specific preferred language, your choice here will override their preference.Estimated Segment SizeBased on the conditions and filters you set on the second step, you will see a number in this section which is an estimation of the (current) number of profiles that should receive your email. As noted in the text below, this number can change if profiles are added to (or removed from) the event matching your segment.If this doesn‚Äôt look like the right number of profiles, it will be best to save your email as a draft and check the data in your event, ensuring it matches the segment options you chose.Saving your design as a templateNow that you have created designs (in as many languages as your Grip application supports) you can save them as a template to use in future email campaigns.As mentioned before, these templates can be used (and removed) by any App Admin in this Grip application. Modifying this campaign‚Äôs design later will not change the template you‚Äôve already saved.As these designs are files, unfortunately we cannot allow spaces or some characters (like slashes /\ ) in the template name. The template name must also be unique within this application.Save campaignIf you‚Äôd like to simply save this campaign as a draft and send it later, click this button. All of your settings and any designs you‚Äôve made will be saved and can be edited later.If you‚Äôve previously made a campaign and scheduled it to send in the future, clicking the ‚ÄúSave campaign‚Äù button will not cancel the previously set schedule.ScheduleClicking this button will allow you to set a date and time at which your campaign will be sent. The timezone is shown and will always match the timezone of the event, in order to make remotely managing events easier.You can cancel sending from the main Campaign page before the scheduled send time, by clicking the three dots at the end of the campaign email row in the table, and selection 'Cancel send'.You can also choose to activate ‚ÄòRegistration AutoSending‚Äô at this stage -see details here.Send NowClicking this button will bring up a confirmation dialogue, and then will schedule the campaign to go out in 5 minutes from the current time. This grace period allows you to ‚Äòundo‚Äô the action in case there‚Äôs a last-minute issue!You can cancel sending from the main Campaign page before the scheduled send time, by clicking the three dots at the end of the campaign email row in the table, and selection 'Cancel send'.You can also choose to activate ‚ÄòRegistration AutoSending‚Äô at this stage -see details here.Unsubscribe LinksYou'll notice that the pre-defined templates and even the empty design include a section at the bottom containing an unsubscribe link. This is of course a mandatory link for legal reasons, and should not be removed.If you are confident editing HTML you can modify the text surrounding this link, and the word 'unsubscribe' itself, but you must not break the link. We have added validation when testing or sending an email to check for the presence of the correct link, in order to safeguard the email system, and you, legally.If you see this message, you have broken or removed the unsubscribe link in (at least) one of your email design variants. You will need to add it once more to be able to send the email.If you have completely deleted the unsubscribe section you can recreate it from scratch - simply add a new HTML block to your email, delete the placeholder text, and copy and paste the below code:<div style="font-size:11px;color:#8d8d8d;line-height:140%;text-align:center;word-wrap:break-word"> <p style="line-height:140%">You're receiving this email because you registered for {{event_name}}.</p> <p style="line-height:140%"> </p> <p style="line-height:140%">To stop receiving emails, please contact the organizer to de-register for the event, or you can <a href="%tag_unsubscribe_url%">unsubscribe</a>.</p> </div>Copying EventsWhen you copy an event, the campaigns for that event are also copied into your new event, with their designs and subject lines. However, there are two things to note about this process:Campaigns created in our legacy email designer will not be copied to new events. This is effectively any campaign created before the 18th of December 2023.Segmentation options arenotcopied, as they are not necessarily compatible with your new event. This means that you'll need to make sure to target the right attendees before you send your new campaign, because if you leave the segment step blank, all your attendees will be emailed!Disabling Emails or Deactivating EventsDeactivating your event or disabling emails via the Settings page will both have the same effect on your Campaigns:Emails will stop sending.AutoSending will be disabled for all Campaigns.Any scheduled emails that haven't already been sent will have their scheduled send time cancelled and be returned to a draft state.You will not be able to create or update any existing Campaigns.Both of these actions can be undone but your campaigns will need to be resent - they are not enabled automatically.FAQsQ: Can I edit campaigns created in the old email editor?A:No, campaigns created in the old email editor cannot be edited in the new editor. They will continue to be sent if already scheduled, but you cannot modify them.Q: What happens if I disable emails for an event?A:Disabling emails will stop all campaign emails from sending, including those scheduled or set to AutoSend. Campaigns will return to a draft state and will not resume automatically when emails are re-enabled.Q: Can I save my email designs as templates for future use?A:Yes, you can save your email designs as templates to reuse in future campaigns. Templates can be accessed by all App Admins within the Grip application.Q: Will a participant receive an email if their profile is modified to fit a different segment with Registration AutoSending enabled?A:No, Registration AutoSending will only trigger an email if the participant's profile matches the segment criteria at the time of registration. To ensure all relevant participants receive the appropriate emails, it's best to create AutoSending campaigns that cover all possible profile segments.Q: Are notes visible in the "Interested in You" emails sent to event participants/attendees?A:No, notes are not currently visible in the "Interested in You" emails sent to attendees.

Title: Deep linking and Pre-Population of Login Credentials

URL: https://support.grip.events/deep-linking-and-pre-population-of-credentials-for-the-grip-web-app

Content:
Deep linking and Pre-Population of Login CredentialsWhen following links to the web platform, you can simplify participants' journeys dramaticallyGrip has a built-in deep link system, along with a method to pre-fill login details when following a link to your event. Combined with our flexiblecampaign email system, you can quickly streamline the login process to make your event participants' lives a lot easier.Thedefault Smart Marketing Links and Session links in Grip emailsalready use these features, so you don't have to worry if you use our campaign email templates and automated emails. However, if you want to direct your participants to more specific places within your web event after login, keep reading.What is a Deep link?A deep link is just a link to a specific place within a website or app. At Grip, this could be a Profile, Session, Navigation Item list or more. Following a deep link means that after you've logged into Grip, you're taken straight to that specific page instead of just going to the default Homefeed or recommendations page.Currently deep links only work in Grip's web platform, and not in mobile apps. If you use the Smart Marketing Link, people that open the link on a mobile device will simply be taken to the relevant app store or installed application, and won't be redirected within the app itself.We are working on adding this functionality to mobile in the future.Example: Organisers will sometimes want to create a custom link in order to direct participants straight to a specific Company Profile within the Grip event.Why use the Smart Marketing Link?The Smart Marketing Link is a dynamic link to your event that is automatically configured when you create an event. Seethis article for detailson why it is used.This should generally be the base of the URL you're creating, in order for your mobile users to directed to the mobile apps. As mentioned above, deep links won't work for the mobile apps, but you may prefer to at least direct mobile users to the app, instead of the link opening in their browser on their cell phone - which is what would happen if you simply copy and paste a URL from your desktop.If youdowant to direct mobile users to their browsers instead of their apps, you can ignore the Smart Marketing Link and take the base URL from what's in your browser's address bar when you're logged in to the event on web.Where can I deep link to?Here's a list of places that you can direct participants to after login. As above, in each of these we would recommend that the <base_url> is your smart marketing link. You can then add the additional parameter to the end of that URL as shown.To link to a specific Profile, Session, or Navigation Item list, you'll need to get the ID for it to use in the URL instead of the <> section - that is explained in the section below this one.With no deep link added, the user is directed to the Homefeed if configured, or the 'Recommended for You' page if there's no Homefeed for the user's data type.A Profile: The below structure can be used to link to a specific profile such as a Sponsor or Speaker:<base_url>?thing_id=<thing_id>Event Agenda: The below structure can be used to link to the event agenda in the platform:<base_url>?event-agenda=trueMy Schedule: The below structure can be used to link to the My Schedule page of the participant - very useful for reminders about pending meetings for example:<base_url>?schedule=trueA Session: The below structure can be used to link to a specific session on the platform, such as a roundtable or sponsored session.<base_url>?session_id=<session_id>My Profile: The below structure can be used to link to the users' profile edit page, for easy updates:<base_url>?profile=trueNative List Navigation Item: The below structure can be used to link to a specific native list, such as an attendee or exhibitor list:<base_url>?list=<extension_id>Teams Portal: The below structure can be used for deep linking to the Teams portal.If the user has access to Teams but has not created one, or has an invite pending, they will be taken to the My Teams page where they can create a team or see the status of their existing invite.Note that if the user does not have access to Teams at all, they will be taken to the page but will see an error telling them they're not allowed to continue. They can just navigate away from the page to clear this error.<base_url>?teams=trueTeams Portal > Team Members: The below structure can be also used for deep linking to the Teams portal, specifically to the team members page. This is what is used in Teams invite emails, for example.All of the notes regarding Teams access in the previous point apply here too.<base_url>?teamMembers=trueGetting IDsEvery profile, session and Navigation Item native list have their own ID, which you'll need if you're trying to direct a participant to a specific page. You can find some IDs in the dashboard, but the simplest way is to log in to your event, visit the profile, session or list that you want to link to and then look at the current URL in your browser's address bar.Example: After clicking on a Session in the event agenda, I'm on its details page, where I can see the description and speakers. In my browser's address bar I can see:https://matchmaking.grip.events/jack2023/app/session/161714As you may have guessed, the number at the end is the session ID.After building a deep link with the Smart Marketing Link to this session using the rules above, we would end up with the following result:https://annereal.app.link/Jack2023?session_id=161714For Navigation Item Native Lists, this is the only way to get the ID you need. However, for Sessions and Profiles, you can retrieve the ID by looking in the dashboard.IDs in the DashboardFor Session IDs, go toEvent Details > Event Agenda. You can either find and open the session you want to link, or you can just choose to show the 'Session ID' column in the table as shown below.Note that sessions also have a session registration ID - that's a separate ID and not relevant here!For Profile IDs, go toDataand then find the profile you want under its data type, or All. The ID is the first column in the profile list table.Also, if you open a profile's details in the dashboard, you can see the ID listed on the right hand side in the 'Basic profile information' section.You can also see deep links detailed in the bulk exports downloads that are generated from the Dashboard profile list page.Warning:these links are set to use the basic Grip domain (matchmaking.grip.events), so if you're using a custom domain in your event, these links will take participants to the wrong place. One option would be to use the find and replace function in a spreadsheet program, to replace "matchmaking.grip.events" with your custom domain.What is Link Pre-population?Link Pre-population is where we add participant information to the URL link that they follow. Doing this means that we can 'pre-populate' (autofill) login details for the person following the link, making it a lot easier for them to log in.Example: We use pre-population in our welcome emails, which means that when the user clicks on the pre-built button, it will autofill the participant's email address in the email field, and Registration ID in the Badge/Registration ID field. This basically means the user doesn't have to copy and paste their details from the email in order to log in to the event and makes the whole journey easier for them.Grip Login ExperienceThe login experience with email and badge ID pre-population will depend on whether it's a first-time login, a subsequent login and also whether the event usesSingle Sign On.First Login, no Single Sign On:Email Address > Registration ID > Create PasswordIf an Event Participant is signing in to Grip for the first time, the user will land on the Email input page, then the Badge / Registration ID confirmation page. On these pages, the Email and Badge / Registration ID can both be pre-populated.Once the Event Participant has pressed "Claim Account" they will be asked to create a password and then will be logged in.Subsequent Login, no Single Sign OnEmail Address > Registration ID > Create PasswordOn any subsequent login (if the user is not still signed in due to cookies) the participant will be asked to input their email address (which can be pre-filled), and then enter the password they created the first time they logged in.Single Sign-OnIn a event where single sign-on is enabled, the login page could be a simple email address & password combination page, or may be hosted on a website separate from Grip. This will depend entirely on the details of the SSO provider. It is possible that at least the email address can be pre-populated, but again this cannot be confirmed, as SSO configurations can be entirely custom and vary greatly.How can I create pre-populated URLs?Similar to deep links, we use a specific format to add these dynamic details to the end of a URL, as follows:<base_url>?badgeid=<badge_id>&email=<email>&auto=trueFor each user, the url will be different, as of course they have a different email address and registration ID (sections in bold above).Let's take a standard Smart Marketing Link as an example. This might usually be:Adding email and registration details to the link would result in:https://lur9.app.link/MyEvent?badgeid=ABC123&email=myemail@email.com&auto=true(this would take you to the login page for Grip Virtual, and fill in your email with 'myemail@email.com' and your Badge ID with 'ABC123')Note: If you were to only include one part of the pre-population, you could prefill only the email address for example:https://lur9.app.link/MyEvent?email=myemail@email.com&auto=trueUsing deep links with pre-populated login details:This is a combination of everything we've already written about above. You'll end up with a link that takes the user to a specific place within an event, and also pre-populates details during login.This is exactly how our Session links in Campaign and Automated emails work!<base_url>?badgeid=<badge_id>&email=<email>&auto=true&session_id=<session_id>Here's an example leading to a particular profile:https://lur9.app.link/MyEvent?badgeid=ABC123&email=myemail@email.com&auto=true&thing_id=1837583Single Sign-On Events:Deeplinks for Single Sign-On providers are custom and totally dependant on the service provider. Often, the login process is not completed on the normal Grip login screen, and is handled by a separate site, in which case it's usually impossible to deep link, as another system handles the URLs.Similarly for pre-population, as Grip is not in control of the login credentials, it is often not possible to pre-populate login details. if the login process is completed on the normal Grip login page, it can be attempted using the normal email parameter, and a separate parameter:ssopass?id=XXXThis might be multiple values in reality, depending on the SSO system that Grip is integrated with.Note that for Single Sign-On events, registration IDs are never added to URLs for security reasons - Grip welcome emails for example will strip out this part of the URL. This is because depending on the SSO provider, Registration IDs may be private keys which should not be publicly seen in a URL.Can I use deep linking if I use a custom SSO Protocol?Hopefully yes, but specific structures apply to the URL that might be different than what is outlined in this article.Can I pre populate URLs even if Event Participants are not yet registered in Grip?No, even if you are using pre-population of URLs its important that Event Participants are already registered in the Grip platform.

Content:
How to create a branded user guide?To create visually appealing branded user guides using Figma, you can follow the steps below. By following these steps you can create comprehensive and user-friendly guides that will enhance the overall event experience for all participants.What You‚Äôll Need:The Participant Guide template in FigmaA Figma account (Free version works)3 event graphics:Home Banner (128 x 57 pxAND1440 x 600 px)Event Banner (115 x 35 px)Event Logo (55 x 55 px)Event Hex Color1.Getting Startedüé®TemplateTo start a new project in Figma, click on theUser Guide Template provided above. Within the same file, you'll find Instructions and Participants guides in the left-hand navigation bar.Click Open in Figma in the top right corner.2. Upload and Resize AssetsTo add the branding to your new Figma file, drag and drop the appropriate assets or files from your computer into the Figma canvas you created in Step 1, into any of the grey spaces.‚ö†Ô∏è Do not drop or add the graphics into the white Instructions area.Ensure you have 2 graphics for the Home Banner as you will utilize two sizes of this particular graphic. You can copy and paste from within Figma or drag and drop that file twice. Select the image and on the right Design menu, you will find the option to set the width (W) and height (H). These by default will be locked proportionately, which is what you want to leave. Set the dimensions to approximately what is indicated in the instructions for each of these assets. It is better to have the images be slightly larger than indicated, than too small.Repeat this process for all 4 graphics.3. Replace Template AssetsOnce the dimensions are set, copy the image and select the appropriate ‚Äúimage‚Äù under the respective graphic on the left menu. For example, if you‚Äôve copied the Event Home Banner at 1440 x 600 px, copy the ‚Äúimage‚Äù under that particular graphic‚Äôs heading. Right-click and choose the option ‚ÄúPaste to replace‚Äù, or paste it from the keyboard using theShift+Command ‚åò / CTRL+ Vkeys. *Repeat this process for all 4 graphics.You will then notice that your user guides have changed from the Grip standard branding to the branding of the event.4. Update ColorsIt's important to ensure that the colors perfectly match the hex colors of your specific event. To do this, simply head to the right-hand side of the Instruction file and look for the menu titled ‚ÄúColor styles‚Äù. Click on the Guide Color item and select the "edit style" adjuster button beside it. A new window will pop up with a properties pane where you can paste the event‚Äôs Hex color. This will update all accent colors to your event‚Äôs Hex color.5. Update Event NameFinally, ensure that you include the name of your event within the pages of the User guides. To do this, access the Participants Guides from the left navigation menu and press theCommand ‚åò/ CTRL + Fkeys on your keyboard. Type ‚ÄúSHOW NAME‚Äù into the search bar. This will highlight the "SHOW NAME" holder text in yellow. In the Replace with‚Ä¶ field add your event‚Äôs name.*Once you have entered the name, click the "Replace all" button to apply the change to all fields, or use the ‚ÄúReplace‚Äù button to adjust one-by-one if you‚Äôd like more granular control of the text.6.ExportOnce you are happy with the changes you have made, you can export your user guides.Select the pages you want to export in the left Layers navigation menu.*Be sure to select the individual pages and not the entire section at once. You can choose to export specific ones rather than all of them if you‚Äôd prefer.From here you can select the format you want to export the file, such as PNG, JPEG, SVG, or PDF. We recommend the user guides to be exported into a PDF file. Click the ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button at the bottom-right corner of the screen once you‚Äôre happy with your selection.After the export is completed, you‚Äôll see a ZIP folder in your download (or a single file if you‚Äôve chosen to export page-by-page). Once you unzip the folder you can see the individual pages of the participant guides.7. Merge Files (optional)If you‚Äôd like to combine them into a single file, you‚Äôll need to merge the pages. You can use a website likeiLovePDFto do so.To merge the pages you downloaded into one PDF file, use the website and upload the desired pages. Once the pages are merged, download the file and re-name it to your preference. We suggest either‚ÄúEvent Name Attendee User Guide‚Äù or ‚ÄúEvent Name Exhibitor User Guide‚Äùfor example.

Title: Grip and GDPR: Ensuring Data Protection and Matchmaking Success

URL: https://support.grip.events/grip-and-gdpr-ensuring-data-protection-and-matchmaking-success

Content:
Grip and GDPR: Ensuring Data Protection and Matchmaking SuccessThe General Data Protection Regulation that came into play on the 25th of May 2018 is there to protect the interest of consumers and provide them with a greater choice of the services they use, and how they use them.We wholeheartedly agree with what GDPR stands for and are proud to see Europe leading the way in protecting the privacy of consumers in the digital age.In this article, we hope to provide clarity on how we are dealing with the new data protection laws at Grip by adhering to the new standards that will, in fact, make the need for matchmaking at exhibitions even more important.Germany as a front-runner in events and data protectionLuckily, we also know that the events world does not have to suffer under these new regulations as the German event organizers have already had similar laws for a number of years. At Grip, we already work with event organizers in Germany under these laws and have demonstrated the Grip Matchmaking Solution can be extremely successful under those data protection laws.Grip Matchmaking Solution & GDPRBelow we will outline the various relevant definitions of GDPR and how Grip is dealing with them to comply with the new regulations.Data Controller:The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other bodies which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.In an event setting, the event organizer is considered the Data Controller.Data Processor:A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other bodies which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;In an event setting, Grip is considered a Data Processor who processes personal data on behalf of the organizer which are covered under theData Processing Termsthe Data Controller (Event Organizer) and the Data Processor (Grip) agree on.Legitimate Interest:The most flexible lawful basis for processing, but you cannot assume it will always be the most appropriate. It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people‚Äôs data in ways they would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing.For the Grip Matchmaking Solution, this means that organizers can share the information of all attendees, exhibitors and exhibitor representatives with Grip as there is a legitimate interest that someone that registers for an event will want to have access to the exhibitor list, event program and other information.It does however not mean that we can display the information of visitors on Grip without them having pro-actively logged into Grip and having consented to ourTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy. We have therefore made it possible to only display active users across our platform.Marketing Consent:Whereas ‚Äútransactional‚Äù emails such as sending someone their registration badge falls under Legitimate Interest sending a mass email to promote a particular exhibitor or speaker does not. It is therefore required for organizers to get specific, optional, informed and specific consent for marketing communications.For the Grip Matchmaking Solution, this means that we offer organizers the possibility of telling us which users they have marketing consent for. We use this information to determine who we send a mass-welcome email to our platform. People that have opted out marketing can still log in, but do not receive a welcome email to our platform.Third parties:Means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data;For the Grip Matchmaking Solution this mean services such as Mailgun (Email Service Provider) or Mixpanel (Analytics). Both are named in ourPrivacy Policyand are covered under the EU-US Privacy Shield. Without these services, it would be impossible to provide the Grip service.Data Processing Terms:Any business that is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a Controller needs to have in place an appropriate contract with any other Controller that it jointly shares data with if that Controller particularly is outside the EU. More importantly, any Controller that is subject to GDPR needs to have in place an appropriate Data Processing Agreement with any third party that it shares data with where that third party is a Processor. as defined under GDPR.For the Grip Matchmaking Solution, this means that we have decided to publish our standard Data Processing Agreement on our website. In collaboration with the Event Organizer changes can be made to the Data Processing Agreement for specific events.Right to object to processing for scientific, historical or statistical purposes:a controller must have a lawful basis for processing personal data. However, where that lawful basis is either "public interest" or "legitimate interests", those lawful bases are not absolute, and data subjects may have a right to object to such processing.A crucial part of the Grip Matchmaking Solution is the Grip Matchmaking Engine and we rely on Legitimate Interest to process the data of an individual for scientific, historical and statistical purposes.However, when a user logs into Grip we offer them the option toOpt-Into continued anonymized processing for scientific, historical or statistical purposes. Although many event solutionsdo notobtain this consent at Grip we have decided that we want to be transparent and provide users with an option to not take part in us using their anonymized usage data to improve the Grip Matchmaking Engine.Grip Legal Documents:Privacy Policy:https://grip.events/privacy-policy/Terms of Use:https://grip.events/terms-of-use/Acceptable Use Policy:https://grip.events/acceptable-use-policy/

Title: Onsite Networking Experience Best Practices

Content:
Onsite Networking Experience Best Practices*As of October 2021, Grip Web Networking is no longer supported on Internet Explorer due to Microsoft announcing that they will be sunsetting the browser come June 2022This article provides inspiration for organisers when planning their onsite experience in conjunction with using the Grip Matchmaking Solution.ONSITE SUPPORT ELEMENTS:Support HelpdeskMeeting LoungeGeneral SetupA large part of the onsite experience and the best practices depend on the type of meeting locations you're having in the platform. In general, we advise having an app & networking helpdesk as part of the Meeting Area in a dual function if you have a Meeting Lounge.If you do not have a Networking Lounge, we suggest doing one of the following:Bundling App/Networking support with your registration support at the entrance of the venue.Placing a helpdesk in or near your Exhibitor¬†Lounge where a Grip Customer Success Manager can also talk prospective new exhibitors through the benefits of the platform for exhibitors.Positioning a support Helpdesk on the tradeshow floor will provide a high-level of interaction but might not be the easiest for people to find when they really need it.A reminder of the Grip Meeting Location MatrixSupport HelpdeskPlease find below a list of examples of support desks that hopefully provide inspiration for your event!Laure, Lee, and Jake - Proud members of the Grip Team onsite at Money 20/20 in the PayPal Lounge.Maria, member of the Grip team onsite at Silmo as part of a dedicated "app helpdesk" on the trade show floor.Meeting LoungeIn general, there are a couple of 'best practices' around creating a great onsite networking experience in regards to the design of the Meeting Lounge.Crucial points to keep in mind are:Always go for High Tables, Table Tops or High Boys! No matter what you call them go for tables that people can stand on in combination with an optional two stools. The main reason is that this eliminates the problem of having to drag around chairs if a third person joins the meeting (something that frequently happens). The other reason is that otherwise, people will start chilling and working in your Meeting Lounge which can obstruct the flow of meetings and cause frustration among delegates.KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid). Tables should be positioned in a clear grid layout. This makes it easy for people to find their table and avoids confusion. It also makes it easy for people to know when they are in the 'meeting lounge.Generally don't require people to "check-in". While partitions can give a feeling of exclusivity which can be desirable when there is no more than 10 meeting tables in an area this is not advisable when you get above this number, why?The math simply doesn't add up. Assuming every check-in takes 15 seconds on average. This means that with two people you can "check-in" 8 people per minute. With meeting slots of 15 minutes, and let's say 50 meeting tables you would need to check-in 100 people in a period of roughly 5 minutes which is just doesn't work and would require A LOT of support people.This event had 100+ Meeting Tables in a single open-plan space at the centre of the Exhibition Floor.100+ Meeting tables across two areas, one in the back of the hall and one at the centre of the Exhibition Hall.Premium networking area overlooking the trade show floor.

MustMeet Platform TypesWe will show you the different types of MustMeet Buyer platforms and what they mean.In this article we will cover:Classic MustMeet PlatformAny2any MustMeet PlatformRestricted Any2any MustMeet PlatformSetup RequirementsClassic MustMeet PlatformThere are two MustMeet Groups in this platform. Often referred to as "Suppliers"; who supply a product and service, and "Buyers"; who demand a service or product. Buyers can only have pre-scheduled meetings with the Suppliers and vice versa.TypeSupplierBuyerSupplierNoMeetBuyerMeetNoGolden Rules:One data type will always have more weight. Your PM will ask you this question, and when generating the scores, apply this rule.Locations are assigned to the Supplier (User) or Buyer (User). Unlike the free flow platform where the locations are assigned to the companies and the reps inherit the locations; in the MustMeet platform, classic locations are assigned to the users (Reps). Every single representative requires a single location.Only one data type is assigned a location, either the supplier or buyer.Locations are configured as a booth by your PM, in the same way that they are created in the free flow platform.Smart Scheduling MustMeet PlatformIn the Any2Any MustMeet platform, every data type can meet.TypeSupplierBuyerCo-ProducerDistributorSupplierMeetMeetMeetMeetBuyerMeetMeetMeetMeetCo-ProducerMeetMeetMeetMeetDistributorMeetMeetMeetMeetGolden Rules:Locations are public and not assigned to any type or user.

Title: What are MustMeet phases?

URL: https://support.grip.events/smart-scheduling-hosted-buyer-phases

Content:
What are MustMeet phases?Understanding the phases in a MustMeet event gives you a better idea of what your attendees will experienceMustMeet events are split into 3 overall phases, with some minor stages within. This is because unlike live networking events, MustMeet attendees are required to perform certain actions at certain times, and Event Organizers also need time to generate the meeting schedules for their attendees.These phases are:Initial PhaseClosed PhaseLive Networking PhaseIn each phase, specific messaging is shown in the event platform for attendees, letting them know whether they need to take action or sit back and wait for their meeting schedules to be published.Note: MustMeet phases only affect attendees that are in MustMeet groups. Any other event attendees that are not in a MustMeet group have a normal view and can take any action permitted by your event's permissions.Initial PhaseEvent platform accessible via Web onlyStage 1:Users canonly perform basic actions like editing profiles. Preference selection and recommendations are unavailable. This is an optional step, used to give time for attendees to answer onboarding question to help fill their profiles, and complete company profile pages before attendee lists are made visible to each other. You can skip to Stage 2 if all (or the majority) of event data comes from registration and profiles are already nicely populated.It's recommended to use permissions to prevent attendees from browsing user lists or searching for those that they might be meeting with later, until such time as the Event Organizer is happy that profiles are complete enough.In this stage users will have access to the following items:Profile sectionEvent Agenda: Add event agenda session the scheduleMy schedule: View the scheduleNavigation items: See and search profile list, links etcHomepage (taking into account data type/group permissions)Please note, for the Navigation and Homepage Items users can only view the list of attendees. Users will not be able to take any actions such as "Must meet", "Meet" and "No thanks".Stage 2:¬†Preference selection and recommendations are available.In this stage, users are able to set preferences: "Must meet", "Meet", "No thanks" on their recommendations, profile lists in the navigation bar, and homepage section. This is the main action for attendees to complete in MustMeet events and so is one of the most important steps.Attendees are able to do anything that they could do in the previous Stage, but importantly, now the preference buttons are shown on profiles that they are permitted to make preferences on. Of course, if permissions were restricted in Stage 1, they should be modified in Stage 2 to allow attendees to see and make preferences on each other.Note: Attendees can still continue to update their profile, view the various navigation items, event agenda and add sessions to the schedule.Closed phaseEvent platform accessible via Web onlyStage 3: Meetings are currently being scheduled.Once users update their profiles and set preferences, we move to the closed phase; schedule meetings. At this stage Grip can calcute scores between attendees and then create a meeting schedule with the highest quality meetings.Moving to this stage will prevent your MustMeet attendees from making any more preferences on each other, and it will also hide the My Schedule page temporarily. This gives you time to generate meetings, make any schedule modifications, and push to Grip without your attendees seeing schedules before you're ready.Stage 4: Meetings have been generated provisionally.By this stage, meeting schedules from MustMeet have been pushed back to the Grip platform. Attendees in this stage are able to view the My Schedule page again, and so check out their provisional meetings and inform the event organiser if they would like to make any changes. Organisers can make these changes to meeting schedules in the MustMeet system and push them back to Grip as many times as is required.You can always move back and forth between stages 3 & 4 to hide the My Schedule page while meetings are being modified.Stage 5: Meetings have been scheduled and finalized.In this phase, meetings are 'finalized' and pushed from MustMeet to the Grip platform. We move to this stage once attendees confirm their provisional meetings, and the organiser is happy to proceed to the next phase. In this closed phase, users can Chat to their existing connections, butcannotmake interest actions, or book meetings.The Exports page in Teams also becomes available for those that have access.Live Networking PhaseEvent platform accessible via Web and Mobile AppIn this phase, users have the ability to view their finalised meetings and schedule additional free flow meetings. Userswillbe able to chat, connect, and book meetings in any HB time slots.Note: Users will not be able to re-schedule any "Pre-scheduled" meetings. They need to contact the organiser to do this for them on the Grip dashboard.FAQsQ: Why don't I see the 'Export' button under 'My Team' on the web event platform?A:The 'Export' button becomes available once the event enters the live networking phase in MustMeet.Q: Why can't I access the event platform via the mobile app?A:The event platform becomes accessible on the mobile app once the MustMeet event enters the live networking phase.

Title: How do I configure a MustMeet event?

Content:
How do I configure a MustMeet event?A starter guide for the basics needed to run a simple MustMeet eventThis article explains how to configure MustMeet settings for a hosted buyer style event. There is an extensive set of features within MustMeet, but most can be added once you're comfortable with the overall process. This guide covers the main points needed to run an event, while linking out to other articles for those that want to know more.In this article, we will cover the following:MustMeet overviewHow to configure MustMeet in your eventAvailability ManagementHow to configure MustMeet slot visibilityFAQsMustMeet overviewRunning a MustMeet event will allow you to bring groups of participants together using prescheduled meetings. Grip uses a combination of participant preferences and AI to find the best matches within your audience, and creates a tailored schedule with many options to suit difference requirements.Before you start configuring your event, consider the following:Do you want to run a bilateral Buyer <> Supplier style event, or just allow various groups to meet one another? Check thePlatform Types articlefor more details.Where and when should your participants meet? MustMeet requires certain meeting location setups depending on the type of event - though in all cases your prescheduled meetings need to be in locations that have the same time slot setup as each other. Seethis article on Meeting Location Assignment.How long do you have to run your event? You need to allow time for participants to login, update their profiles, and make preferences on each other, and then for the meeting schedules to be generated and approved by your team and the participants. See theMustMeet Phases articlefor more details.If you're going for a Buyer <> Supplier event, should all your meetings be 1:1 or do you want to allow Suppliers to have multiple representatives assigned to the same meetings? See ourarticle on Sharers in MustMeet.There are other powerful features that can affect the way you manage your event, but these questions are a great starting point if you're new to MustMeet.How to enable MustMeet in your eventStep 1:Create Custom GroupsMustMeet relies on Custom Groups in order to identify the different participants who will be meeting. You'll need to create these groups before you can configure MustMeet, even if you don't have attendee profiles to put in them yet.See ourarticle on Custom Group setupfor MustMeet to get started.Step 2:Enable MustMeetIn the Grip dashboard, select an event and expand to the Event Settings menu item. If you see a MustMeet item, click on it. If you do not see a MustMeet option, speak to your Grip contact person - MustMeet needs to be enabled in your application first.On the MustMeet page, enable the toggle "Enable MustMeet Experience".Step 3:Add Groups to MustMeetOnce the MustMeet setting has been enabled for the event, the MustMeet Custom Groups need to be added to in the Pre-Event Configuration section:Under Pre-Event Configuration, select all Custom Groups that need to be addedPress save at the top of the pageIf you want attendees to make preferences on Company profiles instead of (or as well as) attendee profiles, see our article onCompany Preferences.Step 4: AddPreference limits for each groupTo ensure that users are making thoughtful meeting selections and valuable meeting schedules are generated, we set maximum and minimum limits for the meeting preferences between buyers and suppliers.The preference limits should be configured before¬†Initial Phase Stage 2:Preference selection and recommendations available.Preference minimums can help encourage your attendees to make more preferences, which will lead to better meeting scores, but limits are important too. If you allow your attendees to make too many 'No Thanks' preferences for example, you may see a reduction in the overall number of matches that can be made.Steps to add preference limits:Ihe Pre-Event Configuration section, select 'Configure' next to each Custom Group.Toggle on/off actions per group (MustMeet, Meet, No Thanks). Some event organizers allow only one group to make MustMeet preferences for example, which makes their preferences significantly more impactful to the meeting scores.Set minimum and maximum preference limits for Must Meet, Meet, No Thanks. For some advice on how to calculate rough limits based on the number of attendees, refer to the¬† articleRules and Calculations for setting Preference Limits.Step 5:Change the MustMeet phase throughout the eventThe MustMeet phases control the experience that your attendees have in the event. You'll need to move through the phases as your event moves forward - though not every phase is mandatory. Again, seetheMustMeet Phases articlefor full details.Availability ManagementIn normal events, attendees are able to modify their availability to set busy periods where they can't receive meeting requests. You may want to allow this behaviour in MustMeet events too, so that attendees can manage their own time. However, doing so will mean that there are fewer slots available to generate meetings in, and could result in worse schedules for those attendees with time restrictions.If the meeting schedule and quality of meetings are the most important things for you, you could consider disabling the ability for attendees to mark themselves as busy. You can do this from the Data Type settings:MustMeet Availability Import SettingsIf attendeescanedit their own availability, and you're making changes to the meeting schedule later in the event, you may notice that a data import in MustMeet 'fails', and informs you that some individuals availability has changed and they can no longer make the meetings that have been scheduled:This is a safety mechanism that prevents meetings being cancelled without the event organizer's consent.For example:Meeting schedules have been finalized and it's the first day of the eventAn attendee, Lauren, has decided to block their calendar for the duration of the MustMeet meetings. Their reasoning is that they want to dedicate their time to their prescheduled meetings, and so don't want any other requests coming in at the same time.The Event Organizer is making some minor changes to the schedule for other attendees who are running late.In this scenario, Lauren is going to attend her MustMeet meetings, but has marked herself unavailable. The Event Organizer wants to keep Lauren's meetings, even though it looks like they should be unbooked.To control this feature, you can change the behaviour during imports using the 'Import Settings' option on the MustMeet configuration page.The first import in MustMeet will always run as normal. The second and any subsequent imports will check this option and deal with availability changes for individuals according to this setting. There are three options to choose from:Inform and cancel import (default behaviour)Continue and remove meetingsContinue and ignore availability changesThe default behaviour will be to stop the import and list the users with availability changes, informing the event organizer that they should resolve the affected attendees‚Äô calendars, or change this setting in Grip in order to move forward.The second option will simply remove any conflicting meetings automatically. This allows the event organizer to remove affected meetings and regnerate meetings for the entire event for example, or allow for people thatareactually now busy and need new meetings.The third option skips checking availability (for affected attendees) moving forward, relying on the initial data that was pulled in the previous import. This means that people can block out whatever time they like and MustMeet will still consider them free. For many events where MustMeet is happening alongside regular networking, this is what many event organizers will prefer, as they want to protect their prescheduled meetings while allowing attendees to modify their availability for normal meeting requests.After changing this setting, you'll need to run another import in MustMeet to continue.MustMeet slot visibilityThis setting, which is only available in the Live Networking phase, allows for event organizers to control whether regular networking attendees are able to book meetings in meeting slots that are usually intended only for MustMeet meetings. This feature is great for filling any gaps between pre-scheduled MustMeet meetings and fill up any leftover time - assuming that there will beno further changesto the MustMeet schedules.Enabling the MustMeet slot visibility toggleBy default this toggle is off, but once the event is in theLive Networkingphase, it will be visible in the MustMeet settings (see image below).¬†This means that the setting will be hidden on the dashboard during theinitial and closed phasesof the event.Should you choose to at theLive Networking phase, you can enable the option to show these MustMeet slots to all event users. Now normal users can book meetings in any available slots, even if they were originally intended only for MustMeet meetings.If you do choose to enable this option, please note thatyou will be prevented from going back to any of the previous MustMeet phasesunless you disable the toggle once more. This is because there is now potential for regular meetings to block MustMeet slots, which will prevent a new schedule being created. If you want to go back and regenerate the MustMeet schedule, you need to be certain that there are no clashes, and all MustMeet slots are available.FAQsWhat happens if I have chosen to allow MustMeet locations to be visible to regular attendees, then I want to return to one of the earlier phases to change my MustMeet schedule?If the setting has been turned ON, you‚Äôll need to switch it OFF again first, to be allowed to return to one of the earlier phases. Make sure that no regular meetings have been booked in the MustMeet slots.

Title: How to configure Custom Groups for MustMeet events

Content:
How to configure Custom Groups for MustMeet eventsGroups play a very big role in MustMeet eventsThis article explains how to set up your Custom Groups for MustMeet events. In this article, we will cover:OverviewHow do group permissions work?How to Set Group PermissionsWhat are metadata keys?How to add Custom Group metadata keysOverviewIn MustMeet events, Groups are used to control which sets of participants are involved in the MustMeet experience, and what their role in the event is. The reason that groups are used instead of data types is to allow Event Organizers to select partial sets of participants across multiple data types, instead of having to create a dedicated data type for each type of MustMeet participant.This simplifies the setup and reduces the number of very similar data types in the event.Once your Custom Groups have been created in the dashboard, they must then be configured with permissions similarly to data types, to inform the platform which Groups can see and get recommendations from others.How do group permissions work alongside data type permissions?Custom Group permissions are set individually per group and allow the Event Organizer to specify other groups that members of a group can see, or be recommended. They only ever apply to profiles that are in a Custom Group - if a profile is not a member of any Custom Group, then they are not affected by group permissions in any way. There is an example below which should help explain this further.Group permissions sit above data type permissions, so they act as a sort of second filteron topof any data type permissions that have been set already. They will not allow group members do anything that their data type already restricts them from doing, so you can effectively only further restrict permissions by adding more at the group level.Group permissions can be applied in non-MustMeet events, though this is rare.ExampleYou have two data types in your event, Attendees and Representatives. Data type permissions allow each data type to only see and be recommended members of the other data type, so Attendees cannot see other Attendees.You then create two Custom Groups, Group A and Group B. Each group contains a mix of attendees and representatives. There are also some attendees and representatives that arenot part of anyCustom Groups.Group A's permissions allow its members toonlysee and be recommended members of Group B, and vice versa.Data Type Attendee - Group AThis participant can only see and be recommended Exhibitor Reps that are part of group B,andExhibitor Reps that are not part of any group.Data Type Attendee - not part of any GroupThis participant can see and be recommended every Exhibitor Rep in the event.Data Type Rep - Group AThis participant can only see and be recommended Attendees that are part of group B,andAttendees that are not part of any group.Data Type Rep - not part of any GroupThis participant can see and be recommended every Attendee in the event.This will be the same in reverse for members of the other group.How to configure Group PermissionsOnce the Groups have been created, click "View" and then into "Edit Group".In Recommendations, select who this Group can receive Recommendations of.In Profiles, select who this Group can see profiles, search and see lists of.To save your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page and press "Edit Group".What are metadata keys?Metadata is a general term for 'additional data' that can be attached to something, to serve some sort of extra purpose. In Grip we use metadata attached to a Custom Group in order to tell other parts of the system how to treat the group in a MustMeet event.If you're not running a MustMeet event, you don't need to worry about metadata keys.All Custom Groups must have at least one metadata key attached to them calledgroup_type. This flag tells the MustMeet system how to treat this group when it comes to generating scores and meeting schedules for its members.If a Group does not contain agroup_type, then the meeting scores will not be generated for its members, and they will ultimately be left with no MustMeet meetings in the event.How to add Custom Group metadata keysOnce the Groups have been created, click in "Edit Group"Below "Unstructured Metadata" select "Add"Enter the Metadata Key:group_typeEnter the relevant values per Group(details below)Important!To save the key, press 'Add' again(as if you were adding a new key)To save your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page and press "Edit Group"There are different ‚Äúgroup_type‚Äù values that you must enter dependent on the type of MustMeet event:MustMeet Classic events (for Buyers and Suppliers)Buyer Group ‚Äúgroup_type‚Äù should have the value‚Äúbuyers‚ÄùaddedSupplier Group ‚Äúgroup_type‚Äù should have the value‚Äúsuppliers‚ÄùaddedAny2Any events (where any group can meet with any group)Every Group created must have the value‚Äúany2any‚ÄùaddedYoumustbeexactwhen entering metadata keys and values - even when it comes to capital letters! If there are spelling mistakes or incorrect upper or lower case letters anywhere in your keys or values, they will not be recognised.That's it! Your groups now have the appropriate permissions and metadata in order to function within your MustMeet event.

Rules and Calculations for setting Preference LimitsIn this article, we will cover:Using the MustMeet CalculatorRules and Calculations for setting Preference LimitsUsing the MustMeet CalculatorTo make it really easy to see if your MustMeet configuration will lead to a great event, use our calculator. Simply provide yourEvent Detailsbelow, and the calculator will immediately tell you if your configuration needs adjusting. Additionally, it will provide you with the ideal combination of Preference Limits to configure in the Grip Organizer Dashboard.Rules and Calculations for setting Preference LimitsMust Meet LimitsAs a general rule of thumb, there should be an upper limit of 10% of Must Meets that both the Supplier and Buyer can select. Our general advice is to NOT have a minimum limit on Must Meets.For example, let‚Äôs say you have 200 Buyers and Suppliers, either group should be able to select no more than20 Must Meets.Meet LimitsAs a general rule of thumb, there should be a minimum of 10% of Meets that both the Supplier and Buyer select. Our general advice is to NOT have a maximum limit on Meets.For example, let‚Äôs say you want to generate 20 Meetings per Supplier. And there are 100 Suppliers. It should be possible to select at least10 MeetPreferences.No Thanks LimitsAs a general rule of thumb there should not be more than 50% of the meeting slots that need to be generated in No Thanks preferences.For example, let‚Äôs say you want to generate50meetings per Supplier. And there are100Suppliers. It should not be possible for a Buyer to set more than25No Thanks Preferences.

Title: MustMeet - How to configure preferences on company profiles

URL: https://support.grip.events/mustmeet-how-to-configure-preferences-on-company-profiles

Content:
MustMeet - How to configure preferences on company profilesAllowing your participants to make MustMeet preferences on companies is a time-saving and intuitive optionOften, participants don't know the individual representatives who are attending an event on behalf of companies. Instead, they only know that the might want to have a meetingwith the company. Most MustMeet events are set up to allow participants to show interest in other participants directly, which can result in the best meetings because they can be specific about the role of the person they want to meet. However, Grip also allows participants to show interest in companies, which can simplify the preferences phase.It works in the following way:‚ÄòMeet‚Äô, ‚ÄòMust meet‚Äô and ‚ÄòNo thanks‚Äô action buttons are displayed on company profiles, which attendees can use to make their preferencesThe company‚Äôs representatives can make their preferences on attendeesMeeting scores are based on all of the preferences made - which could be participant > company and participant <> participant.Participants that are related to a company that received preferences will all share those preferences equally.Should there be a high enough score generated to warrant a meeting, a meeting is scheduled between one of the related company representatives and the person that made preferences.In order to set up this feature, you'll need to be somewhat comfortable with MustMeet event setup.If you're not quite yet, we recommend viewing our articles onHow to configure MustMeet,how to set up Custom GroupsandMustMeet - Generating and using Meeting Scores.How to configure preferences on company profilesCreate and your buyer/ supplier groups as normal.Add the relevant participant profiles to the buyer/supplier groups.Create an additional group for all companies. Importantly, keep the metadata field for the company group totally empty.Update your Group permissions to allow the people making preferences against companies to be 'recommended' that group. Here's an example using the most common scenario, where Buyers can make preferences on Supplier companies. In this example, Buyers willonlybe able to make preferences on Companies, although they are able to see all profiles.Set up your preferences limits -see here for help.You‚Äôll then need to make sure that the group containing people that need to make preferences against companies are permitted to do so.Again, here's an example using where Buyers can only make preferences on Supplier companies:For the Supplier Companies group, leave their preference settings as per the default. You do not need to set or modify any limits as Companies do not log into the platform - but you should leave all of the 'Actions' toggles enabled.When in the live phase, company profiles will appear with MustMeet action buttons, which attendees should use as normal.Once the preferences phase is over, you can generate the meeting scores in the same way you would normally. Our articleherewalks you through this.Note that youdo not needto include the ‚ÄòCompanies‚Äô custom group when generating the scores. If companies are included exist in your event, and they are added to your dedicated Companies Group, they will be automatically added to the scoring matrix.FAQCan I set up company preferences on both sides of a Buyer <> Supplier event?Yes! There's no difference to the setup for this configuration, you just need to create two company groups and ensure that all participants are related correctly to their company profile. Note that you can still only haveSharerson one side, either Buyers or Suppliers. You can still useExclusivityto ensure that multiple people from the same company don't meet each other though.Can I have participants make preferences on other participants as well as company profiles?Yes! Grip will copy company preferences down to their related participants, but any preferences made directly on participant profiles will also be taken into account. We follow the usual process of taking the 'stronger' preference where multiple have been received - so if a company has received a Meet preference, but one of their representatives has received a 'MustMeet' or 'No thanks' preference, we will use the stronger preference ( 'MustMeet' or 'No thanks') for that individual.

Title: MustMeet: Exclusive Meetings

Content:
MustMeet: Exclusive MeetingsEnsure your participants don't waste time meeting multiple people from the same companyThis article will walk you through the Exclusive Meetings feature in MustMeet, and why you might want to use it.What does Exclusive Meetings mean?How do I set up Exclusive Meetings?Generating MeetingsFAQWhat does Exclusive Meetings mean?Exclusive Meetings is a specific property that we can apply to individuals in a MustMeet event. When someone is flagged as having Exclusive Meetings, the system will ensure that they won't meet two different people from the same company at the same event.This can be really useful to ensure that prospective Buyers aren't getting the same pitch from two different people that are working for the same Supplier company. For Any2Any events, exclusivity can be even more important as there is usually only a single group of participants, and there's not much point in two people from the same company meeting each other!In Buyer <> Supplier events, exclusivity can be set up to function across a mixture of both buyers and suppliers at the same time.Exclusivity and SharersNote that Exclusivity is distinct from theSharers concept described in this article, and can work alongside and independently of it.This is because Sharers negate the need for exclusivity, as Sharers are always in the same meetings. You cannot meet different members of the same company individually if they are all set up as Sharers, because you'll only have one meeting - with all of them at once.When separate members of a single company arenotset up as sharers, and so have their own individual schedules, exclusivity becomes very valuable in order to prevent other participants meeting both or all of these company members when they only need to meet one of them.Exclusive Meeting ExampleIn the example below, there are two Buyers from the same company and one Supplier. Exclusivity has been set up for all three of these participants, and so only one of the Buyers can meet with the supplier.Non-Exclusive Meeting ExampleIn the example below, there are two Buyers from the same company and one Supplier. Exclusivity hasnotbeen set up for these participants, and so it's possible for both of the buyers to meet separately with the supplier. This is the default configuration in MustMeet events.How do I set up Exclusive Meetings?In order to instruct the system to treat a participant as having Exclusive Meetings, there are two pieces of data that need to be set. This is always done at the individual level.A summary of the required field dataFieldValueCommentexhibitor_idAny shared IDUsed to signify people of the same company.Exclusive MeetingsToggle On/OffUsed to signify the person who will have exclusive meetings.Exhibitor IDWe need some data to indicate which company the participants work for. Simply relying on the Company Name field is not reliable enough due to spelling or departmental differences between coworkers.For this we use the standard"exhibitor_id"field which is the same field used in all events to create relationships between participants and their company profiles. Two or more people that share an exhibitor_id, whatever the ID is, will be considered coworkers.As this field is already used to create relationships, it's possible for participants like Suppliers who have an associated Company profile, that this field may already be defined and shared by a few profiles.See this article for more details.Any profile that should be included in Exclusivity calculations should have an Exhibitor ID set, even if they are by themselves in the event.To update this via the dashboard:Go to Data, and find the individual attendee in the listOpen their profile to edit itScroll down to the 'Relationships' section and check the 'Exhibitor ID' fieldIf it already contains a value, check other profiles that are part of the same companyIf the values for those profiles already match one another, no action is required.If they are different, or absent, update the value in the field so that they match.Or, if they match, but you need the profiles to be considered separately for meetings, either remove or modify the value so that they no longer match their colleagues' profiles. You can discuss this with your Grip contact to ensure that you're not going to accidentally break other relationships within the same event.Exclusive MeetingsWe need to identify which participants will be having Exclusive Meetings.For this, you can simply toggle on the Exclusive Meetings option for the participant in the dashboard. Edit their profile from the list, go to the 'Settings' tab, toggle on (or off) the setting and Save.They should also have the Exhibitor ID field set up and if they have any colleagues, it should match.If a MustMeet platform requires the exclusivity function,the data above must be included in users' profiles when you import them into MustMeet.You can setup exclusive meetings for any type of participant, provided that they have the correct value for Exclusive Meetings, and that anyone that they might meet with in the event hasexhibitor_idcorrectly assigned.The best way to add this data to profiles is in bulk, through registration. If you're using Native Integrations or a managed integration with Grip then ensure that you've planned this in advance and discussed with your Grip contacts - see below. Of course, these values can be input in bulk when uploading participants through a spreadsheet, if that‚Äôs where your event data is coming from.Uploading/Updating via SpreadsheetWhen filling out the CSV template for your participants:Find the Exclusive Meetings column in the spreadsheet.Add Yes for any affected participants.Upload as usual via the dashboard.To remove Exclusive Meetings from profiles in bulk, follow the instructions in the downloaded spreadsheet file to addNoin the cell instead.Uploading via Native or Managed IntegrationsThis data will need to be included in the registration profile data that Grip is receiving from the registration system, but essentially works the same way as the two previous examples.ForNative Integrations, when you're creating an integration in a MustMeet event, at the mapping step you'll see the Exclusive Meeting field in the Advanced Mapping section.See ourNative Integrations article for details on the mapping step.ForManaged Integrations(those handled by Grip), this fields can be added to the incoming data, but you will need to ensure that there is some data in your registration system that can be used for this. Speak to your Grip contact to scope this out.Uploading via Push IntegrationIf you or one of your supplier companies is responsible for sending registration data to Grip via the Grip API, they will need to use this field in the same way.

Title: MustMeet - Meeting Location Assignment

URL: https://support.grip.events/smart-scheduling-platform-meeting-location-assignment

Content:
MustMeet - Meeting Location AssignmentMeeting Location setup is an important part of MustMeet eventsBuyer <> Supplier EventsAny2Any EventsClassic MustMeet (Supplier to Buyer)In traditional Buyer to Supplier event, locations always are assigned toone data type only.This could be the supplier or buyer type depending on how the event is organized, but almost always it's the suppliers who have a location assigned to them.This is because it's not unusual for Suppliers to have a team of staff working at the event who will share meetings across the day with the different Buyers, and it's easier for them to have a consistent table or booth where their meetings are always happening.Conversely, Buyers often attend and represent their companies alone, and so can move from table to table to meet different suppliers much more easily.Setup for the meeting locations in Grip should be as follows:Locations are assigned to one data type only.The location type in "Restricted (used for booths and meeting tables that will be assigned to company or user)" - shown in the meeting location table as 'booth'.Locations should have a Capacity set to 'Maximum Simultaneous Meetings', with a limit of1.Do not use 'Limited number of tables' otherwise each meeting will always haveTable 1assigned, which will be confusing for your attendees.Locations must have (at least) some MustMeet meeting slot times configured.Normal slot times will be ignored for MustMeet meetings and can only be used for normal networking requests.MustMeet Meeting slot times need to all be exactly the same for all MustMeet locations.Locations must be added before meeting schedules can be generated. If a user has no location you will not be able import their scores in MustMeet.Here's an example of a Meeting Location that is set up properly for a classic Buyer <> Supplier MustMeet event:Note that this is the most typical setup, however it's permitted to have both normal and MustMeet slot times configured for a single location if you're running MustMeet meetings and normal networking in the same location - as long as the slots do not overlap. The dashboard will prevent you from saving a meeting location with overlapping slots.Any2Any MustMeet EventsIn an 'Any2Any' MustMeet event, locations arepublic.This means that locations are not assigned to attendees directly, so instead are shared by everyone, with attendees moving between tables for each meeting.Due to this, it's wise to add short breaks in between meetings to give your attendees time to find the next table and avoid a regular crush of people!Settings for Any2Any meeting locations should be as follows:Locations are public and not attached to any profiles.Locations must (at least) have MustMeet meeting slots configured, same as above.MustMeet Meeting slot times need to all be exactly the same for all MustMeet locations.Locations should have a Capacity set to 'Maximum Simultaneous Meetings', with a limit of 1.Do not use 'Limited number of tables' otherwise each meeting will always have Table 1 assigned, which will be confusing for your attendees.Locations must be added before meeting schedules can be generated.The number of locations should be at least half the total number of event participants, to ensure that each pair of people have a table for every slot.Here's an example of a Meeting Location that is set up properly for an Any2Any MustMeet event:FAQsQ: Is it possible to have 3 representatives assigned to 1 table without overlapping prescheduled meetings?In Grip, anyone sharing a meeting locationis considered a "sharer," meaning they will all have the same meetings. To provide separate meeting schedules, you can create multiple, distinct meeting locations that represent the same physical space.For example: 1. Table 1 - Seat 1 2. Table 1 - Seat 2 3. Table 1 - Seat 3

Title: How do I configure Sharers in MustMeet events?

Content:
How do I configure Sharers in MustMeet events?Shared schedules are a powerful feature of Buyer <> Supplier eventsIn this article we take you through the concept and configuration steps for Sharers in MustMeet events at Grip.In this article, we‚Äôll cover:What are Sharers?What are the requirements for Sharers?Sharer RelationshipsSetting up SharersHow do preferences & scores work with sharers?FAQsWhat are Sharers?Sharers, simply put, are MustMeet event participants that share meetings. In general, sharers have the same set of prescheduled meetings as each other, and so their schedule will usually look exactly the same.In Grip, attendees who are set up as 'sharers' all have the same meeting location assigned to them, and so they're all part of any meetings that happen at that location. In reality, they may not all need to physically attend every meeting, but as they are sharing a schedule, any one (or more) of them will attend the meetings happening at that location.This is usually used by a team of suppliers, so that the company can have one schedule of meetings, with those meetings appearing in all of their representatives' calendars, and so divide the meetings up between themselves.Here are some import notes regarding sharers:Sharers are only applicable to the Buyer <> Supplier MustMeet events.Any2any events do not have this function as meeting locations aren't assigned to individual attendees or companies.Sharers can only be set up for the data type that has meeting locations assigned to it.This is usually suppliers but could be either party, as long as only BuyersorSuppliers are assigned locations at your event.Generally, Sharers share the same calendar throughout the entire event.However, it is possible for sharers to mark themselves (individually) as not available at certain times, and MustMeet will account for slight differences in availability where possible.Generally, Sharers will also share preferences.This means that only one Sharer needs to make preferences during the selection phase, and any preferences made and received will be applied to their connected sharers too.Sharers should be set up fully before the event launches in order to properly share preferences and meeting scores.You can add sharers later in the event, but it requires regenerating scores and meetings, and is a much longer process.Sharers don't share non-MustMeet meetings.If your event also has a Live Networking phase, where individuals can create their own meetings, sharers act independantly from one another, just like normal attendees.Example:Imagine that you and two of your colleagues have been invited to the "Event Tech Life" event. Your company, Grip, has 1 meeting location assigned at the event - "Table #3".SupplierGrip: Jack, Kate, EmmaGrip: Jack, Kate, EmmaGrip: Jack, Kate, EmmaBuyerTomaJaneLeylaMeeting Time4:00 - 4:30 Pm4:30-5:00 Pm5:00-5:30 PMMeeting LocationTable #3Table #3Table #3This location is therefore shared by all 3 suppliers. This means that for you and your colleagues, all your meetings will happen at this location, and all 3 of you will meet with1¬† buyer at a timeat Table #3.What are the requirements for Sharers?Sharers need two things in common in order to share their preferences and meetings:Sharer relationship.The attendees need to be related to each other in the event, using a special relationship.Shared location.The sharers must all have the same MustMeet meeting location assigned to them, where their meetings will be booked.Sharer relationshipsIn order to flag to MustMeet that sharers should share preferences, a Sharer relationship needs to be created in the event, and each individual needs to be related to their sharers using a Sharer ID.The sharer ID works just like an Exhibitor ID, but connects participants together instead of the normal participant <> company relationship. We use a special relationship for sharers because there may be instances where not all of a company's representatives want to share their meetings.For example, perhaps the sales team want to share meetings, but the CEO wants their own set of meetings. In this case, the sales team and CEO would have the same Exhibitor ID, as they should all be related to the same Company, but the Sales team will also have a Sharer ID in common, so that they can share meetings.Using the same example, the Sales team would also be assigned a single meeting location, but the CEO would have their own dedicated location.Setting up SharersStep 1 - Creating a Sharer relationship in your eventYou'll need to create the Sharer relationship for your MustMeet event, which will allow attendees within certain data types to be related to each other using the Sharer ID field. Follow the steps inthis articleto create the Sharer relationship, for each data type that can be related. Often this is done for a single data type - so you're permitting 'Suppliers' to be connected to other 'Suppliers'.Step 2 - Managing meeting locationsThere are a few ways to create meeting locations - the most popular is through the data load step below; however it's worth ensuring before this happens that the sharer arrangement is well thought-through. Remember, the following key points:Only one group should be assigned meeting locations (Suppliers or Buyers).Any individual attendees (non-Sharers) need their own dedicated meeting location.Each set of sharers needs to share the same meeting location.Then, ensure that you have set up the default location settings under Meetings > Meeting Locations > Default Location Settings, after which you can move on to the data load.Step 3 - Assigning locations and relationship via data loadThe most effecient way to create relationships and assign locations is via your registration system as part of the data load into your event. This could be via aNative Integration,spreadsheet uploadetc.In order for relationships to be created between Sharers, they just need to have the same Sharer ID. As mentioned before, they can have a separate Exhibitor ID in order to connect them to their wider team members and company - these relationships can all coexist. You'll be able to see that Sharers are connected to eachother by checking their profiles in the dashboard, and also by viewing them in the event.Dashboard:Web Networking Platform:How do preferences & scores work with sharers?Simply put, preferences made by, or made on sharers are shared! That means that if one sharer makes a preference on another participant, Grip will treat all sharers as having made the same preference on that participant. This works in reverse too, with any preferences that are made on one sharer being applied to the sharers they have a relationship with.This means that technically, only one sharer needs to make preferences on behalf of their sharers - though each sharercanlog in and make their own set of preferences, with the results being effectively added together.Of course, during the preference phase, sharers could separately choose to make a different preference on the same participant profile. Where these preferences conflict, the second sharer to make the preference is prompted by the platform, asking them whether they want to continue.For example, one sharer could choose to 'Meet' a participant, and later, another sharer could choose 'No thanks' on the same profile, at which point they'll see the following message:There is a heirarachy built in to preference sharing, where Grip will take the 'strongest' preference if there are conflicts like this:No preference < Meet < MustMeet < No ThanksWhen creating scores for sharers, Grip takes the 'strongest' preferences and applies them to all the sharers, giving them all anequal scorefor each participant match. See ourMustMeet scoring articlefor some examples here.Generating schedules for SharersThere are no additional steps needed to account for Sharers when generating meeting schedules for your event. Sharers are detected automatically in the MustMeet dashboard due to them having the same meeting location. You'll see sharers displayed within the same row in the list of profiles and they'll receive the same set of meetings - whenever availability conflicts allow.FAQSCan sharers make separate preferences?Yes, sharers can make different preferences. Each sharer logs in separately and has their own journey. Those preferences are totally up and shared, and the strongest preferences take priority.If only one sharer logs in and makes preferences, will the other sharers still get meetings?Meetings are only generated for participants who have logged into the platform at least once - in Grip we call this being 'active'. For sharers to receive meetings, they must be active in the event at the point where meeting schedules are generated. They do not need to make their own preferences though, as explained in the article above.How does the sharing functionality work with meeting exclusivity?These two concepts are similar but not the same, and they are compatible with each other. Exclusivity is designed to prevent people having unnecessary meetings with more than one person from a company. If a company's representatives are set up as sharers however, you can't meet them separately anyway.Exclusivitydoesbecome important if you have companies in attendance that have some representatives set up as sharers and some that aren't, in the same event. It is also helpful if you have multiple Buyers from the same company, and don't want them to meet both meet suppliers from the same company, whether they're sharers or not.See ourarticle on Excusivityfor more details.Can sharers have different meeting availability?Yes, they can. In this case, MustMeet will attempt to give sharers the same schedule, but it will exclude some sharers from meetings where they've marked themselves as unavailable. This will depend entirely on how similar the sharer's availability is.When importing data into MustMeet, you'll see warnings for sharers that have different availability. You can continue and ignore these warnings if this is deliberate.Can sharers have separate meeting minimum and maximum limits?Yes, they can. However, as they will share schedules (as much as possbile - see the previous question), there meetings will generally be capped at the lowest limit, or highest minimum target.For example, if one sharer has a maximum limit of 20 meetings, and their related sharer has a limit of 18, both sharers will receive 18 (if possible). This is to ensure that limits are not exceeded.Similarly, if one sharer has a minimum target of 5 meetings, and their related sharer has a target of 10, both sharers will receive 10 meetings (if possible).Again, when importing data into MustMeet, you'll see warnings for sharers that have different targets and limits. You can continue and ignore these warnings if this is deliberate.How can I manually create relationships between two sharers in the Grip dashboard?Assuming that the event has a Sharer relationship set up for the right data type(s), you can manually create relationships by editing their profiles in the dashboard. See the Relationships section ofthis articlefor more details.It's important to note that a Sharer ID is not automatically created for profiles where a relationship is manually created. It's good practice to give any related Sharers the same Sharer ID before or after creating their relationships manually. This ID can be anything you like, as long as it is unique, and profiles profiles have the same value - e.g. "SHARER_087".Can I set up sharers after generating meetings?Yes, though in order to add sharers later, you'll need to recalculate the scores and regenerate the meeting schedules.Use this example as an explanation of the steps you'd need to take.Sharer A - was previously active and made preferences.Sharer B - was not part of the event, or was previously inactive.Set up Sharer B, ensuring that they have a relationship to Sharer A, and both have the same MustMeet meeting location assigned.Activate Sharer B or instruct them to log in to the platform.Regenerate the meeting scores for the event.Reload the data into the MustMeet platform. Check that the two sharers are displayed properly.Regenerate meetings. You can either:Regenerate meetings for the entire event - this will remove all meetings and generate all schedules from scratch, including the new sharer.Manually unbook Sharer A's meetings, and then either:Manually rebook them one-by-one, if you don't want to disturb any other participants' schedules.Use the 'Generate for unbooked slots' function, which will have MustMeet rebook any meetings now available acrossall participants.Approve schedules

Every single supplier (user) should be assigned to a single table unless there is a sharer relationship.When tables are assigned to a SupplierOn the H2H system, always the type that has locations assigned is considered as a "supplier".Supplier group: They provide a service. They have table assignedgroup_type: suppliersBuyers group: They demand a service. They do not have a stablegroup_type: buyersWhen tables are assigned to a BuyerRarely but sometimes organisers assign tables to the buyer type.

Title: Using MustMeet Meeting Targets to Control Participant‚Äôs Schedules

Content:
Using MustMeet Meeting Targets to Control Participant‚Äôs SchedulesSet meeting limits and minimum targets for prescheduled meetingsMeeting Targetsare a powerful feature within Grip‚Äôs MustMeet scheduling system, giving event organizers greater control over the number of meetings their participants are scheduled for‚Äîwhile saving significant time during event setup.Organizers can defineminimumandmaximummeeting values per participant. This is particularly helpful when meetings are part of a paid package or when organizers want to guarantee a minimum meeting quota while capping excess bookings.Note that minimum meeting targets are not available for Any2Any style MustMeet events. If you're interested in this feature being developed for an Any2Any event, please start by speaking to your Grip contact person. Maximum limitsaresupported.In this article, we will cover:What are MustMeet Meeting Targets?How they workSetupHow Meeting Targets are displayed in MustMeetCan I Change or Override Meeting Targets?FAQWhat are MustMeet Meeting Targets?Some organizers offer participants a specific number of meetings as part of a commercial package. These are often framed as:Aguaranteed minimumnumber of meetingsAmaximum limitto avoid overschedulingIn MustMeet events we want this process to be as easy as possible, to avoid the need for organizers to spend hours tweaking meeting schedules in order to stay compliant with these targets. Of course it's not always possible toguaranteea certain number of meetings to your attendees, but as long as your event is set up correctly, you should not see issue with this - see below.How they workWhen generating a meeting schedule, Grip‚Äôs MustMeet system will givepriority to those participants with meeting minimums. This means that the system will first try to ensure that participants have their minimum meetings quota met, before continuing to generate meetings for the rest of the attendees with no minimums set.For maximum meeting values, the scheduler will simplystop scheduling meetings for a participant once they have hit that limit.‚ö†Ô∏èImportant:While the system prioritizes minimums, meeting targets cannot beguaranteedin every case. If event conditions (availability, preferences, group rules, etc.) make it impossible to meet a target, the scheduler will fulfill as much as it can.For example, if there are enough available participants and meeting locations in the event, but a given participant has ‚ÄòMet Before‚Äô or chosen ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô on too many of the other participants, it may not be possible to give them the number of meetings that are desired.If it is possible to hit the targets, the scheduler will do so.üõë Avoid assigning minimum targets to large participant groups (e.g., all suppliers), as this will dilute prioritization and reduce overall effectiveness. The scheduling process prioritises the profiles that you've attached a target to, so of course the more people you try to prioritise at once, the less it's possible to prioritise them.Setting up Meeting TargetsMeeting targets can be configured through:1. Dashboard Manual EntryNavigate to the participant‚Äôs profile in the dashboardGo toSettings > Meeting permissionsUse the following fields:Meeting Organizer limit- a limit to the number of meetings that this participant can personally organize. This is not strictly MustMeet related - see ourarticle here.MustMeet Meeting Target- participant's minimum target for the number of meetings that will be allocated in their MustMeet schedule.MustMeet Meeting Limit- participant's maximum limit for the number of meetings that will be allocated in their MustMeet scheduleExclusive Meetings toggle- Controls whether this participant will be prevented from meeting two people from the same company in their MustMeet schedule. See ourseparate article on Exclusivity.To define limits:‚úÖ Use whole numbers only‚úÖ Use values greater than 0‚úÖ Ensure the minimum is less than the maximum if both are use‚ö†Ô∏èPlease note thatMeeting Minimumtargets are only compatible with Buyer <> Supplier events at the time of writing. Support for Any2Any events is planned, and will be released later.Meeting Limitsare fully compatible with both Buyer <> Supplier and Any2Any events.Of course, these values can be input in bulk when uploading participants through a spreadsheet, via a Native Integration, or from any integration with a registration system, if that‚Äôs where your event data is coming from.2. Uploading/Updating via SpreadsheetWhen filling out the CSV template for your participants:Find the MustMeet Meeting Target and Meeting Limit columns in the spreadsheet.Input the values under each column.Upload as usual via the dashboard.To remove a target or limit from profiles in bulk, follow the instructions in the downloaded spreadsheet file to addRemoveValuein the cell instead of a number.3. Uploading via Native or Managed IntegrationsThis data will need to be included in the registration profile data that Grip is receiving from the registration system, but essentially works the same way as the two previous examples.ForNative Integrations, when you're creating an integration in a MustMeet event, at the mapping step you'll see these fields in the Advanced Mapping section. You can add values to them, map to a source field or even use theRemoveValuefunctionality.See ourNative Integrations article for details on the mapping step.ForManaged Integrations(those handled by Grip), these fields can be added to the incoming data, but you will need to ensure that there is some data in your registration system that can be used for this. Speak to your Grip contact to scope this out.4. Uploading via Push IntegrationIf you or one of your supplier companies is responsible for sending registration data to Grip via the Grip API, they will need to use these fields in the same way. The fields should be added using the 'permissions' JSON object when creating or updating participant registrations:"permissions": {"meeting_organizer_limit": 5,"must_meet_minimum_meeting_limit": 1,"must_meet_maximum_meeting_limit": 5,"must_meet_exclusivity": true}For full details, see our API Documentation in the Grip dashboard.Deprecated fieldsPreviously, these fields were added using special fields under profile metadata (hb_meeting_limit,mm_meeting_minimumetc). This method is still supported but is nowdeprecated. Moving to the new permission fields as soon as possible will not only be easier when it comes to managing data, but will also mean that limits and permissions will become configurableperevent, instead of applying to all events. This is very helpful!Existing implementations using the old metadatafields will continue to function temporarily.When data is detected in both the old and new fields, only the new field data will be considered.Organizers should begin transitioning to the new MustMeet fields.Legacy support for metadata-based targets will be removed in the coming months.üîß Reach out to your Grip contact person for assistance with adopting the new fields.How Meeting Targets are displayed in MustMeetWhen these values are detected by MustMeet after importing your data, you should see these targets displayed in the participants table under the‚ÄòMeeting Targets‚Äôfield. If you‚Äôve used a minimum and a maximum, you‚Äôll see a bracket of meetings shown.Don‚Äôt get confused with the ‚ÄòEstimated Meetings‚Äô column - this is a quick calculation done by the MustMeet platform which does not take into account the users‚Äô individual targets. Instead this is a general estimation based on the number of participants and slots, if meetings could be shared out evenly.Can I Change or Override Meeting Targets?In short, yes you can!If you‚Äôve not generated your meetings schedule yet, you can modify the field values as much as you like, as they‚Äôre only taken into account once schedules are being generated.If you‚Äôve already scheduled your meetings and want to add meeting limits retroactively, you‚Äôll need to add the data in Grip, load into the MustMeet platform, and then either:Regenerate all meetings (if there are lots of participants‚Äô targets added). This will remove and replace all previously-generated meetings.Remove the booked meetings manually for whichever users have new Meeting Targets, then ‚ÄòGenerate for Unbooked Slots Only‚Äô, which will take into account these new limits while trying to fill up any available slots in the event.Additionally, you can always choose to manually modify any participant‚Äôs schedule in MustMeet, and the system will allow you to break these limits yourself. You can refer to theMeetings Reportto check whether the changes you‚Äôve made have broken any of the rules.FAQI have set a Minimum Meetings amount for a participant, but they don‚Äôt have enough meetingsEnsure that conditions allow this participant to have the desired number of meetings. There are many elements that go into a meeting schedule - here are some things to consider:There are enough available participants to meetThere are enough available meeting slots left in the eventThe participant hasn‚Äôt blocked out too much of their calendar availabilityThe participant hasn‚Äôt made a ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô preference against the other available participantsThe participant hasn‚Äôt already met the other available participants in the current eventThe participant hasn‚Äôt ‚ÄòMet Before‚Äô the other available participants in a previous eventThe participant isn‚Äôt already meeting another participant from the same company, whereExclusive Meetingshave been setThe participant isn‚Äôt prevented from meeting other available participants due to Group or Data Type permissionsThe participant isn‚Äôt prevented from meeting other available participants due to multi-venue Group rulesI have added the required fields and values to a participant‚Äôs profile but I can‚Äôt see the targets reflected in MustMeetThe data has not been detected by MustMeet. Check the following:The values input are valid whole numbers and make senseMake sure you have reloaded data into the MustMeet system after making the changeOne or more participants have a meeting limit/permission set, even though I didn't add one in this eventThis is due to a participant having a meeting limit or permission using the old metadata fields, usually because of an old or separate event. Open their profile in the dashboard, go to the 'Settings' tab, and look for data under the 'Unstructured Metadata' section.Assuming that you do not want these targets/limits/exclusivity settings applied, you can remove the following fields and their data:hb_meeting_limitwwe_meetings_uniquemm_meeting_minimumOnce done, you can Save the profile and then reimport data into MustMeet.

Title: MustMeet Scoring

Content:
MustMeet ScoringMustMeet scoring uses AI-generated recommendations and participant preferences to ensure only highest quality meetings and appointments are scheduled.In this article, we'll cover:Overview of MustMeet scoringScoring Matrix - Buyer to SupplierScoring Matrix - Any2AnyOverview of MustMeet ScoringIn a MustMeet event, Grip calculates ‚Äòscores‚Äô between all participants, which is what allows the system to work out which meetings to book. These scores are based mostly on the preferences of the participants (e.g. ‚ÄòMeet‚Äô, ‚ÄòMust Meet‚Äô, or ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô), along with the preferences of any Sharers (participants who are sharing a schedule of meetings with a colleague).These scores are generated in Grip, and are exportable from the ‚ÄòScoring Matrix‚Äô tab in the MustMeet dashboard page, although you will also see them in the MustMeet platform when you‚Äôre generating schedules. You can use the tables below for an insight into why certain participants may have higher or lower scores than others.Please note the following important factors regarding score calculations:Scores rank from 0 (no meeting) up to 98 (meeting will be scheduled if possible).A ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô preference outweighs all other metrics, and creates a score of 0.This means that if Participant A has chosen ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô against Participant B, no meeting will be booked - even if Participant B and any Sharers have chosen ‚ÄòMust Meet‚Äô against Participant A.Similarly, if participants are flagged as having Met Before in a previous event, and no new preferences have been made between them in the current event, a score of 0 will also be generated as it is assumed that they will not want to meet again. The date before which this is calculated can be controlled when generating scores.For instances where not all users for a potential meeting have made a preference against one another, Grip also relies on its AI system to determine more or less compatible matches, modifying the scoring slightly to suit. You can see this in the score ranges in the matrices below.Scores are calculated differently for the two types of MustMeet event;Buyer to Supplier(HB Classic) orAny2Any.Buyer to Supplier(HB Classic) events have a slightly stronger weighted group. This is usually the ‚ÄòBuyer‚Äô group but can be controlled by adding the stronger group first in the Scoring Matrix page in the Grip dashboard.You can also influence scores much more dramatically by preventing a groups from making any ‚ÄòMust Meet‚Äô preferences at all, limiting them to just ‚ÄòMeet‚Äô and ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô.For Buyer to Supplier events where participants that are set up as Sharers have made different preferences against the same person, the ‚Äòstronger‚Äô preference is used, but again with ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô overruling all other choices. Sharers will always receive the same score as each other. For example:Three Sharers - one chooses ‚ÄòMust Meet‚Äô, 1 chooses ‚ÄòMeet‚Äô, one makes no preference = we take ‚ÄòMust Meet‚Äô.Three Sharers, two say must-meet, one says ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô = we take ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô.There is no way to manually change the scores that have been generated. You can of course manually modify meetings in MustMeet if you want to override the schedule.Scoring Matrix - Buyer to SupplierHere we have used the Buyer group as higher-weighted.SupplierNo thanksNo responseMeetMust MeetBuyerNo thanks0000No response05-2833-4565-75Meet050-606494Must Meet075-859598Scoring Matrix - Any2AnyScores are symmetrical as there is no higher-weighted group.No thanksNo responseMeetMust MeetNo thanks0000No response02-5860-7075-85Meet060-707590Must meet075-859096

Adding Meeting Preferences from the Grip Admin DashboardIn this article, we'll explain how as an Administrator you can create Meeting Preferences for the Grip MustMeet Solution from the Grip Dashboard.MustMeet Preferences consist of 3 options: Must Meet, Meet and No Thanks.Users are able to set their MustMeet preference themselves from <event_name">https://matchmaking.grip.events/ > however, sometimes clients might choose not to do so or the organiser, as part of providing a greater service might call or email the attendee about their preferences on their behalf. </event_name">It is important to note, Meeting Preferences from the Grip Admin Dashboard overwrite any permissions and limitations set on the front-end this means:Meeting Preferences can be set above the limit. Meaning that if there is a limit of 20 must meets set for example, from the Admin Dashboard you can still continue to add Must Meet preferences even if that exceeds the limit.Meeting Preferences can be set from the Admin Dashboard event if the event is in the Closed Stage. More information on the different MustMeet solution stages can be foundhere.If that's all clear please follow the steps below to add Meeting Preferences from the Organised Dashboard.1. Go the user's profile in the dashboardSelect your app and event and follow the steps to open the profile of the user you wish to add meeting preferences for.2. Press on "Create Preferences"In the right sidebar, you'll see a number of options. If your event is in Stage 1a/b or Stage 2a/c you'll be able to "Create Preferences". Please note if you are in the "Live Networking Phase" the button will say "Create Swipe" instead.3. Specify the¬†PreferencesYou can now select the type of preferences you wish to add (Must Meet, Meet, or No Thanks). You're also able to select multiple users in a single step to make it easy and efficient to add the preferences.ORyou can apply this function via the MustMeet section;1- Click on the "MustMeet" section2- Click on "Create Manual preference"3/4- Select from "Buyer" to a "Supplier"5- Target group: If your supplier belongs to more than 1 supplier group, you can select the right group6- Select the appropriate preference and click on "Create Preference"Well done!

Smart Scheduling Golden Rules (MustMeet)In this article we will walk through some smart scheduling golden rules to give you a better understanding of the Grip MustMeet platform. Below is a list of the smart scheduling golden rules:The Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for active usersThe Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for available time slotsIf one participant says "no thanks" to a meeting, the meeting will not be generatedThe number of meetings at an event depends on the number of "No thanks", "Number of active attendees", and "Attendee availability"The Grip MustMeet platform generates meetings for the entire number of time slots at an event. Grip does not generate meetings per dayThe Grip MustMeet Platform generates meetings based on "Must meet", "Meet" and "No thanks"If a user activates their profile and takes no action, meetings will be generated based on the AI recommendationsThe Grip Scoring MatrixThe Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for active usersThe Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for active attendees. Grip does not generate meetings for inactive users. If you want inactive users to receive a meeting schedule, you must login on their behalf prior to switching to the closed phase.The Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for available time slotsThe Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for available time slots. If an event has six time slots and the user blocks out two, the user will only get four pre-scheduled meetings. This means, if a user blocks out a large amount of time within their calendar, this could impact the number of meetings generated for them.If one participant says "no thanks" to a meeting, the meeting will not be generatedIn the Grip MustMeet platform, if a participant swipes "no thanks" on another participant, no meetings will be generated between the two. The score is going to be zero.Click hereto see the Grip Scoring Matrix Below.The number of meetings at an event depends on the number of "No thanks", number of "Active attendees", and "Attendee availability"The number of meetings for an event depends on three variables:1."No thanks":If one participant swipes "no thanks", no meetings will be generated.2.User availability:The Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for available time-slots.3.User status:The Grip MustMeet platform only generates meetings for active users.The Grip MustMeet platform generates meetings for the entire number of time slots at an event. Grip does not generate meetings per dayThe Grip MustMeet platform generates meetings for the total number of time slots at an event. The Grip MustMeet platform does not generate meetings per event day.Example below:Event name: Event Tech LiveAttendee: SaraDay 1: six time slotsDay 2: eight time slotsGrip will generate a total of 14 meetings for Sara. (Not six meetings on day one and eight meetings on day two).¬†If a participant would like to have four meetings on day one and five meetings on day two, you will have to go to the users' profile and block one available slot on day one and three available slots on day two.The Grip MustMeet platform generates meetings based on "Must meet", "Meet" and "No thanks"Recommendations; Grip uses a users' data (reg data + onboarding) to kickstart the AI and recommend the best potential connections to a user.Preferences; "Must Meet, Meet, No thanks", for Grip to be able to generate high quality meetings, users should swipe "Must Meet, Meet, No thanks" on the recommended connections that have been generated for them.If a user activates their profile and takes no action, meetings will be generated based on the AI recommendationsIf a user activates their account and does not take any actions, the platform will randomly create scores between the user and their recommended connections. The score will be between 5-25. You can refer to theMustMeet¬†scoring matrix here. Please note, this is likely to result in a low quality meeting.The Grip Scoring MatrixWhen in the Classic Smart Scheduling platform (Buyers and Suppliers) or in the Any2any Smart Scheduling Platform users set preferences against each other, Grip generates a set of scores and then these scores are converted into meetings. The higher the score, the higher quality the meeting will be. The Scoring Matrix is shown below.

Content:
Generating Meeting Scores in MustMeet eventsMeeting scores allow MustMeet to create meetings for everyoneIn this article, we'll explain how you can generate meeting scores in your Grip MustMeet event, and how you can use these to generate meetings. You'll need to be an App Admin in Grip in order to take these steps.Initial StepsScore WeightingMeeting Cutoff / Met Before dateFinal StepsInitial StepsGo to Event SettingsClick on "MustMeet"Click on the "Scoring Matrix" tabSelect the "Preference Matrix Type"If your event is a classic Hosted Buyer event, select "Buyer Vs Supplier"If the event is Any2any HB select "Any to Any"The matrix type should match the configuration that you set for your Custom Groups.Score weightingForBuyer <> Supplier eventsBuyer <> Supplier events have a natural score weighting, where the Buyer groups' preferences are scored slightly higher than Suppliers. This matches the typical arrangement in this type of event, where the Buyer's opinions and satisfaction are usually more important to the Event Organizer. See ourarticle explaining MustMeet scoringfor some examples of this slight difference in score calculation between the two sides.In Grip, you'll need to chose which of your groups are given this extra weighting - and note that this doesn't necessarily need to be your Buyers group.Where it says 'Buyer Custom Group' add the Custom Group that should have a stronger influence over the meetings (i.e. you would like the meetings to be weighted in their favour).Where it says 'Supplier Custom Group' add the Custom Group who should have a weaker influence over the meetings.If you've set upcompany preferences, remember that you donotneed to add your company group(s) here.For Any2Any eventsThere is no difference in weighting in Any2Any events, so simply select all of the Custom Groups that should be involved in the scoring process.Past Meetings Cutoff (Met Before feature)MustMeet has a built-in function to flag participants that have had meetings in previous events. This is a really handy feature that prevents repetitive meetings in communities that attend yearly events within the same industry. For more information,we have an article dedicated to this feature.Once you enter the Custom Groups in to the Preference Matrix type, you should set a date for the ‚ÄúPast Meetings Cutoff‚Äù. This date controls when Grip starts to consider meetings for the Met Before flag. This is only used once you've imported meetings into the event at least once, and you need to regenerate the scores to create a new schedule.If you've not previously pushed meetings to this event yet and this is your first time generating meeting scores, you can set the Past Meetings Cutoff to the current date and time. You can then move to the next step.If you have, for the current event, already generated scores, imported meetings, and now need toregeneratethose scores, you'll need to set the date to a momentbeforeyou first imported meetings.If you don't do this, Grip will mistake all the meetings that you've already imported for meetings in previous events, and will mark all of the people involved in meetings as havingmet before!If you've imported scores in to MustMeet and noticed a very high number of 0 scores then this is likely to be the cause.You can undo this quite easily, by re-generating the scores and choosing a date before the first meeting import for the current event.Final Steps5. Click on "Generate Meeting Scores". This will begin the process, which might take a while for large events.6. After a short time, you can click on "Check Meeting Score Status" to see if the scores are generated. You can keep doing this every few minutes until you see that "Meeting scores are available!".7. If you'd like to retain a copy of the scores for your records, click on "Export CSV file" and download the generated file. This is optional.HB ClassicAny2Any and Restricted Any2AnyMustMeet DashboardLogin to H2Hhttps://hostedbuyer.net/Speak to your Grip contact if you've not been given access to MustMeet yet.Select the application and the event.Click on "Import Data"If you have already imported data into MustMeet for this event previously, click on "Reload Data"Once complete, you'll be taken back to the Meeting Schedule page automatically, and you're good to go!

Generating Meeting Schedules in the MustMeet PlatformGrip's MustMeet is the world‚Äôs most powerful meeting scheduler for event organizers.¬†In this article, we‚Äôll look at :How to generate meeting schedules in MustMeetHow to manually modify meeting schedulesHow to get meetings back into your Grip eventPlease note the following:MustMeet is a separate platform to the Grip Dashboard and requires its own login credentials. If you do not have these, please speak to your Grip point of contact.In order to generate a meeting schedule you will need to have completed a number of previous steps - for example:Your participants will haveset preferences against one another in GripYou will have moved tothe closed phaseYou will havegenerated meeting scores in Grip and imported your event‚Äôs data into MustMeetMeetings will be generated for as many participants as possible. If there are a low number of meetings generated, check the calendar availability of your participants, along with any related meeting permissions. Perhaps there are a high number of ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô preferences between participants, preventing meetings from being booked, or there is a large imbalance between the numbers of participants in each group.How to generate meeting schedules in MustMeetStep 1.Log into theMustMeet platformand open your event.Step 2.If your last import has been successful, you should see a list of all of your attendees.For Buyer to Supplier events, you will see two tabs, one for each group of attendees.For Any2Any events, you‚Äôll see one page of attendees with a filter for your Groups.Make sure you‚Äôre happy with the data that you can see; for example, any Sharers should be listed on the same line, and any users with Exclusive Meetings should be marked.Step 3.Click the schedule generator buttonYou will see that there are two options when generating schedules: 'Generate schedules for all', and 'Generate for unbooked slots only'Generate Schedules for AllThis is the most common option when generating meeting schedules, and should be the option you choose if you‚Äôre generating meetings for the first time.This option attempts to generate meetings for all of the participants in the event, across all event days. It may take a little time to run.The only downside to this option is that any existing meetings will be cancelled and a fresh schedule will be created for all participants. This means that if you‚Äôve previously generated schedules for your participants in this event, you may want to use the second option instead.Generate for Unbooked Slots OnlyThis option leaves any currently-booked meetings intact, and will only generate meetings where there are gaps in availability.¬†This is a good option if you have previously generated all of your meetings, and you were happy with them, but since then you have added a few new participants to the event, and you wish to give your new members meetings without affecting the existing schedule.Note that if any of your existing users have availability in their schedules, the MustMeet system will try to fill any and all available slots, which means your existing users may gain meetings with the new attendees you‚Äôve since added.¬†If you have deliberately left empty spaces in attendees‚Äô schedules, then they may be filled again automatically.After generating meetings for unbooked slots only, you can see which meetings were created using this method as they are marked with a particular icon. This can help you double check any meetings that were created during this ‚Äòrebooking‚Äô process.How to manually modify meeting schedulesNow that you have generated your schedules, you have the chance to manually modify your attendees‚Äô meetings. You can open any attendees‚Äô individual schedule by clicking on their row in the table, and you can make changes to meetings by clicking on any slot within their schedule.The green meeting is the one that is currently scheduled (1).If there are other attendees that are available at this time, you‚Äôll see them listed below the highlighted meeting (2), and you can choose for this attendee to meet with them instead by clicking on that row. You‚Äôll notice that the individual scores for each match are shown, allowing you to make an educated choice for this replacement.If you‚Äôd like to unbook this meeting completely, click theUnbookedrow.How to get meetings back into your Grip eventOnce you‚Äôre happy with your meeting schedules, you‚Äôll want to get these back into Grip so that your attendees can check them, and your event can move forward.¬†To do this, click on theApprove Schedulesbutton. You‚Äôll need to click onApprove Schedulesonce more to confirm.In a normal MustMeet event, it is you that will notify your attendees that their meetings are ready to be viewed, and your event must be in theClosed Phase: Meeting have been generated Provisionally,orMeetings have been Scheduled and Finalisedin order for them to be able to see theMy Schedulepage.¬†Seethis articleregarding the difference between MustMeet phases for more details.You should see the MustMeet status page as the meetings are sent to Grip. Once complete, you‚Äôll be taken back to the schedules page again, viewing all of your attendees.You can run through this process multiple times, generating schedules, making changes to meetings and then pushing back to Grip. Each time you push these meetings to Grip, the old ones will be removed and new ones will be created.However, you must ensure that you areonly making changes to meetings from within the MustMeet platform. Editing meetings or meeting locations directly within the Grip dashboard will break the synchronisation between both systems, and will prevent any further changes being made in MustMeet.If you have any questions or suggestions you can reach out to us onsupport@grip.events

Title: How to Set the MustMeet Timeslot Priority in H2H

Content:
How to Set the MustMeet Timeslot Priority in H2HOn the H2H dashboard, you are able to priorities the meetings from 10 (high) to 1 (low) to ranking meetings.When H2H generates meetings in order to keep the balance between the number of meetings and users, it assigns some high ranking meetings and some low ranking meetings. Otherwise 1 attendee would end up with all the high ranking meetings and another with the low meetings. I am going to explain to you how you can manage this by using 1-10 approach.1- Go to the Slot Priority on H2H2- Assign a number between 1 (low rank meetings)-10 (High rank meetings)2.1 You may want to assign all high ranking meetings in the morning and low ones in the afternoon2.2 You may want to assign some high ranking meetings in the morning, some random ranking meetings in the middle and close the date with high ranking meetings2.3 Or you may want to assign all the high ranking meetings in the afternoon and low ones in the morningI would suggest the option 2.1 or 2.2. Again this could be discussed with the client or run by your own decision.

Title: MustMeet Meetings Report

URL: https://support.grip.events/mustmeet-meetings-report

Content:
MustMeet Meetings ReportWe understand that after MustMeet has scheduled meetings, some event organizers would still like to make their own changes and updates. This manual process, however, is¬†prone to errors that can affect the experience of your attendees. For example, meetings for one delegate may exceed the limit or duplicate meetings may be scheduled accidentally. That's why, we're adding a MustMeet Meetings Report to make sure your event runs smoothly after making manual changes.In this article, we‚Äôre going to look at :What is a MustMeet Meetings ReportWhere to find itHow to use itWhat is the MustMeet meetings report?It's a report that allows you to make sure manual edits in MustMeet scheduling do not break the rules expected to be followed by theHosted Buyer Scheduling Process,and thus, won't negatively impact the experience of your attendees. It can flag if a delegate has too many meetings, conflicting times, duplicate meetings, and more.Where to find it?On the H2H dashboard, the meetings report button is located on the far-right. Click on it to open.How to use it?If manual edits have not broken the rules, you will see a confirmation.If manual edits have broken the rules, you‚Äôll see a warning showing the attendees being affected.The following further explains each rule and what you should do if broken:1. Does any delegate have a meeting booked when they are unavailable?This should never occur. If it did occur, it would be caused by a bug in the MustMeet scheduler.How to fix it:contact support@grip.events2. Does any delegate meet another delegate twice?This should never occur. If it did occur, it would be caused by a bug in the MustMeet scheduler.How to fix it:contact support@grip.events3. Does any delegate meet another delegate from the same company?How to fix it: If this rule has been broken, simply look at the schedules for the meeting participants indicated, and un-book the scheduled meeting.4.In a H2H classic event, does any buyer have multiple meetings with suppliers at the same location?If the event is set as H2H classic, rather than Any2Any, this rule will check if a buyer is meeting multiple suppliers from the same company, who would all be at the same location.5. Does any delegate meet another delegate that is exclusive with someone they are already meeting?This means that attendee A and attendee B, for example, have been set to be exclusive on the Grip dashboard. They both work for the same company, and therefore the attendees that attendee A meets with shouldn‚Äôt be met by attendee BHow to fix it:If this rule has been broken whilst editing your meetings, simply go into attendee A or attendee B‚Äôs schedules and delete the meeting.6. Does any delegate have more meetings scheduled than their meeting limit?If this rule is broken, it means the listed delegates have more meetings than the limit you‚Äôve set for them in the dashboard.How to fix it:If you do not wish this to be the case, hop onto their schedules and remove the number of meetings required to bring them below the limit.FAQsDo I have to correct the errors in the report?If for whatever reason you needed a meeting to break one of the rules, that‚Äôs quite alright! Your meetings can still be pushed back to Grip as normal.

Title: How to set and update the Time-slots in MustMeet

Content:
How to set and update the Time-slots in MustMeetBefore we get into updating the time-slots in MustMeet, let me share with you a rule here about setting up a timeslot in the MustMeet platform.Meeting lengths need to be the same across the event in a Smart scheduling (MustMeet) platform. This means that you can have different start and end date per day but but lengths must match.Would having different length meetings on two days affect MustMeet? Yes. The system would rejects this set up.In this article, we will show you how to update/change time-slots in MustMeet in 3 different scenarios;Before meetings are generated in MustMeetAfter meetings are generated in MustMeetAfter meetings are pushed from MustMeet to Grip.In order to explain this process, we assume that:You have already generated the scores in GripPushed the scores from Grip to the MustMeet dashboardTopics coveredI have only pushed the scores to MustMeet but I have to update the time-slots now. What should I do?I generated meetings in MustMeet but now I have to update the time-slots. I have not pushed the meetings to Grip yet. What should I do?I have generated meetings in MustMeet and pushed the pre-scheduled meetings from MustMeet to Grip but now I have to update the time-slots. What should I do?I have only pushed the scores to MustMeet but I have to update the time-slots now. What should I do?This is very simple. Since you don't have any meetings in the event locations on the Grip dashboard, you should be able to easily change the global setting and meeting locations date/time in Grip and push the updated date/time to MustMeet.Update the date/time in "Meeting Global setting" in GripGo to "Location" and click on "Edit all meeting location dates"Go to MustMeet and to the eventClick on "Reload Data" in MustMeet: This is to reload new information in Grip through api to MustMeetClick on "Edit Slot priority" in MustMeet: Double check the accuracy of the date/time and set priorityClick on "Generate Schedules" in MustMeet: When you are ready generate the meetingsClick on "Approve Schedules" in MustMeetI generated meetings in MustMeet but now I have to update the time-slots. I have not pushed the meetings to Grip yet. What should I do?This is also very simple. Because you don't have a meeting in the event locations in Grip, you should be able to update the date/time on the Grip dashboard. Since in MustMeet you have already generated the meetings, you will need to cancel these meetings before reloading the data to MustMeet. Here is what you need to do:Update the date/time in "Meeting Global setting" in GripGo to "Location" and click on "Edit all meeting location dates"Go to MustMeet and to the eventClick on "Cancel Meetings" in MustMeet: This is to cancel the existing generated meetings in MustMeetClick on "Reload Data" in MustMeetClick on "Edit Slot priority" in MustMeetClick on "Generate Schedules" in MustMeetClick on "Approve Schedules" in MustMeetI have generated meetings in MustMeet and pushed the pre-scheduled meetings from MustMeet to Grip but now I have to update the time-slots. What should I do?Here, because you have meetings in the event locations in Grip to be able to update the location's date/time, you have to delete the meetings in Grip first. Then update the global setting and locations in Grip. Later cancel meetings in MustMeet and reload the new update.Update the date/time in Meeting Global setting in GripGo to "Meetings" in Grip and delete the existing meetingsGo to "Locations" in Grip and click on "Edit all meeting location dates"Go to MustMeet and to the eventClick on "Cancel Meetings" in MustMeetClick on "Reload Data" in MustMeetClick on "Edit Slot priority" in MustMeetClick on "Generate Schedules" in MustMeetClick on "Approve Schedules" in MustMeetPlease refer to theNotion pagefor relevant recordings.

Title: MustMeet - "Met Before" feature

URL: https://support.grip.events/met-before-flag-concept-and-set-up

Content:
MustMeet - "Met Before" featureAutomatic protection against repetitive meetingsWhat do we mean by "Met Before"?How to control the Met Before flagWhat do we mean by "Met Before"?Met Before is a function that tracks meetings across different events within a single Grip application, in order to record suppliers and buyers that have had any meetings in the past.The purpose of this is to try to prevent repetitive meetings for your event participants when they're taking part in a MustMeet event.The feature takes into consideration pre-scheduled meetings as well as meetings created by attendee meeting requests in non-MustMeet events - basically any meeting between two or more people.If a past meeting is detected between two people in a MustMeet event, and no preference has been made either way, that pairing will receive a score of 0, which will prevent a meeting from being scheduled. You'll be able to see this on any exports of the Scoring Matrix, and it will also be flagged in MustMeet when you look at booking a meeting between those people.You can still override this and manually book a meeting between them if you like - and again, if either party has made a preference on the other profile, we take that as a sign of their intent to meet, and we ignore the fact that they've met before.What about meetings with different representatives from the same company?Yes, the feature is smart enough to account for situations where the same companies attend year-on-year, but with different representatives. This works in a way similar to MustMeet'sExclusive Meetingsfeature.Buyer <> Supplier EventsThe platform will identifySuppliers(defined by group type) using theirExhibitor IDs, which they should share, as they'll be related to the same Company profile. If there is no exhibitor ID for a specific supplier, then it will default to using theirProfile IDinstead.For non-suppliers, the¬†email address of the profile is used.For example:In a previous event, a Buyer called Jack with the email address "jack@grip.events" met James from Microsoft. James from Microsoft had an Exhibitor ID of "MIC240788".In the next edition of this event, there were no preferences made between the profile with the email address "jack@grip.events" and any profile with an Exhibitor ID of "MIC240788".Therefore, we flag these profiles as having met before, and so no meeting will be booked between Jack and anyone from Microsoft - even if Microsoft's representatives have personally never attended the event before.If either Jack or one of the Microsoft representativeshadmade a preference in the current event, then we would ignore the 'met before' flag, and score them normally so a meeting could be booked.Any2Any EventsThis is much simpler as there are nosharersin Any2Any events, and so each attendee has their own meetings. There's no need to check on the Exhibitor ID, so instead we rely on the Profile IDs only.Example:In a previous event, a Buyer called Jack with the Profile ID 123456 met James, who has a Profile ID of 098765.In the next event, those two profiles will be flagged as having met before, and that pairing will get a score of 0.If either of them make a preference in the current event, then we would ignore the 'met before' flag, and score them normally so a meeting could be booked.How to control the Met Before flagAs a reminder, if you want to force a meeting between people that have met before, you can do so by booking a meeting manually via the MustMeet dashboard. Other than that, you don't need to do anything to make this feature work, it's entirely automatic.However, there is some protection for cases where meetings are created in an event, and then need to be updated a few times due to, for example, changes in schedule or drop-outs. We need to make sure that the meetings in the current event aren't incorrectly recognised as old meetings by setting a date and time after which meetings will be ignored.This is done during the scoring process using the field 'Past Meetings Cutoff', and is explained inthis article about generating scores.Finding attendees that have been flagged as 'Met Before'You'll be able to see when people have been flagged as having met before if you download the meeting scores export, as shown in the article linked in the previous paragraph.This spreadsheet contains a column called "met_before_flag". For any pair of attendees that have met before, you'll see a "1" in that column, as opposed to a "0" for those that haven't.In short, 1 = yes, and 0 = no.You'll also see this explained in the 'score_reason" column and you should also notice that their score will be a 0 - unless of course one of the attendees has made a preference on the other one, in which case we'll score them normally.Here's an example:You can see that two pairs of people above have Met Before.One pair has a score of 0, as no preferences were made between them. No meeting will be booked.The second pair have chosen to meet each other, and so we score them normally.

How to Manage Adding New Users to a MustMeet EventAdding new users during the initial phaseInitial phase - update your profileInitial phase - Select preferencesAdding new users during the Closed phase/Live phaseWhen meetings are generated and no changes have been made in H2HWhen meetings are generated and changes have been done in H2HAdding new users during the initial phaseInitial phase - Update your Profile/Select PreferencesDuring the time that the platform is open for the users to update their profile or select their preferences, the organizer can add new users either directly in the dashboard or automatically through a registration integration with no issues.Adding new users during the Closed phase/Live phaseIdeally, new users should not be imported at this stage, as adding any new participants who haven't had a chance to select preferences will lower the overall meeting scores in the event. As we have no 'intent' data to work from, the meeting schedules will naturally become that much more random.Of course, a single user won't make much of a difference, but adding more will gradually skew the results.If you have already generated your initial meeting schedule, and you have not made any adjustments to that schedule:1- Add the new user to the Grip event2- Activate the user3- Set preferences for the user via the Grip dashboard (if known)4- Re-generate the Meeting Scores5- Reload the data in H2H6- You can either Generate the entire meeting schedule again (recommended), or you can generate just for the empty slots, which will attempt to fill the new user's schedule (and any other participant's gaps) with any leftover meeting space, without removing the existing meetings.If you have already generated your initial meeting schedule, and you HAVE made manual adjustments to that schedule:1- Add the new user to the Grip event2- Activate the user3- Set preferences for the user via the Grip dashboard (if known)4- Re-generate the Meeting Scores5- Reload the data in H2H6-¬†DO NOT¬†"Generate Meetings" unless you are happy to lose the manual changes that you've previously made.Instead,¬†generate just for the empty slots, which will attempt to fill the new user's schedule (and any other participant's gaps) with any leftover meeting space, without removing the existing meetings. Otherwise, you could also manually assign meetings for the new participant with anyone available.

Transfer your app to another iOS Developer AccountApple states all apps must be submitted by the provider of the app‚Äôs content using their own, unique Apple Developer Account, this also applies to existing, already published apps.If you currently have one or more apps published on your developer account, the Apple review will now include this check when you submit a store update. In order to avoid any disruptions in the availability of your app in the iOS store, please make sure all your apps are published on a matching developer account. If the app and the developer account do not match, Apple will potentially reject the update. Your older version of the app will remain available.Fortunately it is possible, and relatively simple, to transfer the ownership of an app to another developer without removing the app from the App Store. When an app is transferred it will keep its reviews and ratings and users will still have access to future updates. You can transfer multiple apps, without limit, but all apps have to be transferred individually.Step 1: Verify that the app can be transferredThe app must meet specific criteria to be transferable.App transfer criteriaBefore an app can be transferred it has to meet the following criteria:Both accounts can‚Äôt be in a pending or changing state, and the latest version of the agreements in the Agreements, Tax, and Banking section must be accepted.No version of the app can use an iCloud entitlement.No version of the app can use a Passbook entitlement.The App must have had at least one version that has been released to the App Store.In-app purchase product IDs on the app can‚Äôt be the same as product IDs on any apps in the recipient‚Äôs account.TestFlight beta testing¬†should be turned off for all beta versions of the app.Sandboxed Mac apps that share the Application Group Container Directory with other Mac apps cannot be transferred.Step 2: Backup all app informationBecause an app is removed from your account after an app transfer, we recommend you backup all information about the app before you transfer it.¬†It‚Äôs a good idea to keep a record of your app ºs metadata and pricing, note dates the app was available on the App Store, and save sales and download information.Step 3: Initiate the app transferThe team agent in your organization initiates the app transfer.Step 4: Accept the app transferThe team agent in the recipient organization accepts the app transfer.Initiate an app transferRequired role:¬†Legal (Team Agent).Click "My Apps" on the homepage.¬†A list of all apps will display. Select the app you want to transfer and scroll to the¬†'Additional Information' section, click "Transfer App,' then click "Done."If your app meets all the criteria mentioned in the start of this article, click "Done." If the app doesn't meet all criteria you should resolve the issues.Enter the Apple ID and Team ID for the recipient‚Äôs team agent, and click "Continue."Read the terms, select ‚ÄúI have read and agree to the agreement presented above,‚Äù and click "Request Transfer."Click "Done" to return to the App Information page.After you initiate the transfer, the app stays in its previous status, with the Pending App Transfer status added, until the recipient accepts it.Accept an app transfer1. Sign in to iTunes Connect as the Team Agent.¬†A notice indicates that an app is ready to be transferred.2. Click "Agreements, Tax and Banking."3. Below "Transfer Agreements," click "Review" next to the app in the "Contracts In Process"¬† section.Support URLAtom feed URL (required if the app previously had an atom feed URL)Marketing URL (required if the app previously had a marketing URL)Privacy policy URL (required if the app previously had a privacy policy URL)CCATS (a new CCATS form is required for apps that useexport compliance)App Review contact informationApp Store contact information5.

Title: How To Use Analytics Tables on Grip as an Event Organiser

URL: https://support.grip.events/how-to-use-the-analytics-library

Content:
How To Use Analytics Tables on Grip as an Event OrganiserAnalytics tables can be used in a variety of ways, in this article we'll cover the most common actions that you can take with them.Please note:Analytics tables are distinct from our new insights reports, Grip Pulse.Analytics tables are extremely powerful and can be used to:Take an in-depth look at data within your eventCreate custom views in order to look at specific dataDownload custom data exportsUse tools to drill down into a specific data setCreate graphs directly from the dashboard that can be downloadedIn this article we will cover:Adding And Removing ColumnsRe-ordering ColumnsSorting ColumnsFilteringCreating Pivot TablesExporting dataAnalytics Data tablesAdding And Removing ColumnsThe new feature allows you add or remove columns to allow you to see the exact data you want to see without needing to download it and manually reorder and delete columns.On the right hand side of the table is a popout menu that shows a list of all available columns. To see this you must have the 'Columns' tab selected and open, if you cannot see the area in the green rectangle on the image above, simply click the 'columns' tab again.All of the columns that are currently displayed will have the boxes beside their name ticked, to add an additional column simply find the name of the column you would like to add, either by scrolling through the list or using the search function in this section.Once a column has been added it will be added to the group in which it exists, for instance in the above example if I were to add 'Meeting Comment' this would be added in the 'Meeting Info' section of the table.You can remove columns from the table by simply unticking them from the box on the right. You can also remove entire sections by unselecting them in this box too.Re-ordering ColumnsYou can reorder columns within the table to either display data in a way that is most logical for you, order it in a specific way ahead of export, or to help with analysis.To reorder a column hover over a column header until you see this reorder icon:From here you can simply click and hold the header and drag it to where you want it to sit on the table.If you move the column to a different section, it will create a label of the section it is part of above it, to avoid confusion:In the example above, I have moved Meeting ID into the 'Meeting Times' section; it still has the 'Meeting Info' label above it.Sorting ColumnsIn order to sort the table based on a column, simply click on the column header.On first click, the column header will display the up arrow and sort the column from smallest to largest for numbers, A-Z for words, and earliest to latest for dates.On second click, the column header will display the down arrow and sort the column from largest to smallest for numbers, Z-A for works, and latest to earliest for dates.FilteringThere are two ways of filtering on the table:Using the column headersSimply hover over a column header until you see this icon:Simply click the icon and the the filtering menu will appear:From here just choose from the options in the dropdown that best describes what you want to filter against:Contains- The data contains the value enteredNot Contains- The data does not contain the value enteredEquals- The data exactly matches the value enteredNot Equal- The data does not match the value enteredStarts With- The data begins with the value enteredEnds With- The data ends with the value enteredYou can choose two filters per column which can be added as either:AND- The data shown will match both filter values simultaneouslyOR- The data displayed will match one or both filter valuesUsing The Filters TabIn addition to filtering using the column headers within the table, you can filter using the filters tab on the right hand side of the table.This offers the same functionality as using the column header to filter, but also allows you to create filters for the table against columns that are not in the table.Copy and paste data directly from the data viewYou can copy and paste data directly from the data table and insert this into a spreadsheet. Simply, drag over the data you want to copy, click copy (ctrl c) and paste into a spreadsheet (ctrl v).Creating Pivot TablesIn order to create a pivot table, you must select the 'pivot mode' in the right hand box.From there select the values you want to display in your pivot table from the columns list.Select the row groups by dragging the desired columns to the 'Row Groups' section and choose the values that you want to add to the pivot table by dragging the values you want to display to the 'Values' section.Exporting dataThe key thing to remember about exporting data from the Analytics Library¬†is that it will export the current view you have set within the table - so whatever columns, filters, ordering etc you have set in the table is how the export will appear.You can also click 'Export all Columns' where you can choose to download as a CSV, or Excel file with all available data.Analytics Data tablesStream ViewsAt Grip, we measure and track the engagement of users that engage with embedded sessions on Grip.The stream view table is a list of the participants who engaged with the session from three different areas on the platform, the main stage, the session page and the home page when a session is promoted.The export will include the following fields:User Profile IDViewers NameEmailSession IDSession NameTime and Date OpenTime and Date CloseSession TypeSourceData Type NamePhone NumberCompany NameTotal View Duration (seconds)Stream views key definitions:Open Events:Session Page, Home Page with sessions and sessions that are promoted when opened from any of the available navigation pages:Session Agenda Page.Session Link.Close Events:Navigate away from the session page using any of the navigation buttons available on the web page:Logout.Navigating away from the session and therefore no longer watching the session page.Profile Links - Users selecting to view a profile.Sponsorship Banners - Users.Live Stream:Steaming Live Content.On-Demand:Recorded Content.Source:This is the place of the views from where the participant has come from to view the session.The three sources:Main Stage.Session Page.Home Page (when a session is promoted).Registered SessionsRegistered Sessions export will showcase the event participants who have added sessions to their schedule along with the additional information about the participant such as data type, custom profile values.Category GroupAnalytics Data Field NameDescriptionProfile InformationProfile IDThis is a unique profile ID of the user that is generated by GripProfile Registration IDThis is the Registration ID usually defined by the event organizers or registration systemProfile NameThis is the profile name of the userProfile Data TypeThis is the data type that is associated with the user, configured during event set upProfile RoleProfile Role will be one of two values.

Content:
How do I use the event data and insights reports in Grip Pulse?This article will help you understand how to use the Grip Pulse event insight reports to understand your event data and take action based on your findings.Contents:Slice and dice your dataExporting raw dataFAQsOverviewGrip Pulse allows you to view insights and analytics of your App and Events in near real time.All Events on Grip have access to core information via the Event Insights dashboard. Event Insights provide powerful insights into the behaviors of your event participants. This dashboard shows how they interacted with each other at your event.You can find details such as badge scanning usage, meeting bookings, and session engagement here. We have grouped these interactions into distinct sections on the dashboard; you can access the different sections by clicking on each tab. Accompanying these sections is a glossary page explaining what some of the terms mean.Clicking on the Event Insights dashboard will open the dashboard in a new tab in your browser. This will allow you to navigate and manage your event while having access to your insights at the same time. You can also choose to switch to another event and compare insights side by side.Interacting with Event Insights - slice and dice your dataYou can interact with some sections of Events Insights by selecting from preset filters or by entering a specific value. For instance, when looking at Search related insights, you can filter the insights, narrowing your view to a specific data type.You may have noticed that an Event ID field is always set in each section. We recommend that this not be changed or removed to ensure that your view of the data is correct for the current event.Interacting with Event Insights - exporting raw dataYou can export the raw data used for each visualization in the Events Insights dashboard for further analysis. Exports can be made in CSV or Excel file formats. The following limits apply for any exportsFor data tables, you can export only up to 1 million rows or 500 MB of data, whichever limit is reached first.For all other visuals, including pivot tables, the limits that apply to exporting are the same limits that apply to the visual type.Support for exports is currently restricted to Chrome and Safari browsers.FAQsQ: Why can‚Äôt I refresh, bookmark, or share my insights page?A: Each insights page is created using a secure connection to you and you alone. This ensures that sensitive data displayed in your event insight reports remain secure.Q: Why do the numbers look different from what I expect?A: Much of our data is streamed into insights in near real time, but there are instances when the data needs to be processed or aggregated with other data sources in order to make sense. This additional processing takes time to complete, depending on which report you are looking at.Q: Why do I see more active participants in my Insights than my current list of users?A: The dashboard always reports what iscurrentto your event whereas your insights will trackhistorical participation over time.One example: a participant may have joined your event and since removed themselves or been removed by you; in this case the participant number in the Events Insights report will be greater than the number shown in the event dashboard.Q: Are there other insights dashboards available?A: Yes, other insight dashboards are available. Contact your Grip Sales representative for more details.Q: Why can‚Äôt I see my exports?A: Check that you are using a Chrome or Safari browser. Support for Firefox is not currently supported.Q: Why is the 'Connections by Data Type' number often double the total connections?A: The 'Connections by Data Type' figure may be double the total connections because it counts the connections separately for each participant group involved. If a connection is made between participants from different groups, it is counted once for each group, leading to a higher total in this breakdown.

These files will also be available in all the text editors (see below).Program: when using the schedule tool is it possible to adjust the row height or is this standard?Yes the row are heights can be adjusted but not by you from the backend. Only via customisation by idloom frontend developers. Otherwise you can create your program table from scratch in the text editors, where you can customise your table fully.Program: Why would I want to create a session in Grip Registration vs manage the entire schedule in the Grip Engage Platform?Creating a session in Grip registration (or ‚ÄúOption‚Äù as it‚Äôs called there) can be very useful for the following use cases:Paid for sessions.An Organiser is looking tocharge for this session/ workshop and Grip registration allows you to sell / up-sell tickets for these workshops as part of the process of buying a ticket for the event.Attendee interest.Given registration usually is available long before the Grip App launches, showcasing key sessions during registration can give organisers an indication which ones are going to be more popular, helping with planning and right-sizing the auditorium.Round table meet-ups. Using each session as a table and having attendees choose a table to meet up around a particular topic. (Currently not an option as these would ideally be private sessions, however registering for a private session via Grip Registration is currently not working)Content: Why can‚Äôt I add sponsors or speakers in a different language?English is the master / base language - sponsors, speakers, exhibitors etc. can only be deleted or created in the base language. This will create a copy of that content asset in any configured language. The copy will need to get its own image and any description / title needs to be localised in the target language (this has to be setup already)Localisation: How can I safely re-set the ‚Äúchild‚Äù languages to create a new updated copy from the English master?When a language ‚Äúchild‚Äù is created it takes a snapshot of the then current content / pages / ordering / pages / registration form fields / logic etc. and creates a copy. It‚Äôs important to get the timing right on this as most content / image assets and form logic should be setup before the localisation task is done (a bit like wayfinding in expoFP) you don‚Äôt want to do it too early before the floorplan is pretty much finalised. If a language copy was created initially (e.g. as a preview / to help the translator etc.) then the best and fastest way to get localisation updated is to delete the existing localisation and re-creating a new copy based on the then current version. This is done by going to General‚Üí Essentials and choosing the non-english language followed by going onto the cog next to the language toggle which gives an option ‚ÄúDelete translation‚Äù.Check Ins: Can an organiser check attendees into sessions (and what about sponsored sessions)?Grip Reg allows attendees to be checked into individual sessions. For this to work the session must be created in Grip Reg under Tickets ‚Üí Options. (You need to create a group first (group = track in Grip as this is mandatory in Grip)Any Sessions you create here will:a)Show up in Gripas a session (with a track and a location if you‚Äôve created a stage / conference room etc.)b)Show up on the registration form(unless you hide the options by setting them to sold out or making them visible only to a certain ticket type)c) When a user signs up for a session this isautomatically added to their ‚ÄúMy Schedule‚Äùin GripOnce the user has received their ticket this will include a QR code (which is also in their mobile app as the My scan QR code) this can be scanned by the organiser staff at the entrance to the session.Using the scanning functionality with idloom (webapp) you can choose which session you‚Äôre going to be ‚Äúscanning in‚Äù for and then scan the badge or the QR code on the user‚Äôs app. A green light will indicate the users is registered for the session. (See image below)Users who are not registered for a session can be scanned and ‚Äúforce entered‚Äù into the session using a simple toggle in the scanning app.Currently sponsored sessions that are using scan-in are not automatically added to Grip Teams as a lead (this is the behaviour on virtual events where attendees of a virtual sponsored sessions are automatically registered as ‚Äúinterested‚Äù for the session sponsor and show up in their lead funnel for qualification).Check Ins: Can either be open or capped to specific ticket types and/or session registration status/wait list status?No -Sessions can be made (in)visible in Grip Registration for certain ticket types and same can be configured in Grip based on a data-type. (Note:that there‚Äôs currently no 2-way sync between Grip Reg and Grip for session level reservations. So, if you add a session to ‚Äúmy schedule‚Äù in Grip that doesn‚Äôt save you a seat - this only can be done within Grip registration. People who have pre-registered in Grip Reg would show up as ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, whereas users who added to ‚Äúmy schedule‚Äù in Grip will show up ‚Äúred‚Äù.Waitlist.idloom hasthis articleon how their waitlist works. In a nutshell people select a ‚Äúadd me to waitlist‚Äù for any sessions that are sold out and they will get an automatic email + link to modify their registration when more seats / capacity is made available on any session that has a waitlist. In order to prioritise VIPs the solution would be a manual email campaign to VIPs that is sent out right after the additional capacity has been added, and before the automated email goes out to everyone. That way they can get VIP‚Äôs a head start on grabbing any new seats.Check Ins: Can I use the Grip QR code as a mobile ticket with the idloom Scan-In functionality?Yes this is supported! You can use the QR code that is generated from the scan_id in Grip and shown e.g. on the mobile homescreen as the code that‚Äôs scannable by a third party access system (e.g. fielddrive) or using the built in system by idloom. To enable this you must set ‚ÄúQR code for external check-in system (using attendee UID)‚Äù in Content ‚Üí Automatic Emails.Check Ins: Can I get a report for multi-day events who showed up on which day?In short this is not an out of the box report. The best way to do this is download the check in data as a spreadsheet at the end of day one. Then at the end of day1 reset all checkins (see screenshot below) which will delete and reset the checkin data and then re-check the person in on the second day. After the event the files can be combined and the timestamps for checkins by users on various days can be used for pivot analysis.Legal & Compliance: Are any 3rd party tools integrated into idloom which transmit PII to 3rd party servers in 3rd countries outside of the EU?idloom system currently uses Google Fonts in the Cloud and Google Recaptcha. For both tools,¬†the IP address of the web visitor is sent to Google server (but no other personal data),¬†having legal implications GDPR wise.For that reason, we are updating our systems to:Host Google Fonts locally in our serversProvide alternatives to¬†Google Recaptcha (e.g. allowing visitors to switch off the tool - other measures are already protecting from spamming bots or implementing a paid European alternative tool like Friendly Captcha)Multi-Reg: Can one person buy multiple tickets (e.g. a PA for their executive team etc.)?idloom system has an option under ‚ÄúTickets ‚Üí Settings‚Äù where multiple purchases by one person can be enabled:Note that any other settings e.g. unique email, individual options (e.g. different workshops), capacity limits, networking preferences etc. are required to be filled in for each ticket that is purchased in one ‚Äúbatch‚Äù. The batch then shows up as a grouped registration in the Attendee List like this:Multi-Reg: Can one person buy an empty ticket and assign it to a staff member to fill in their ticket details (like Tito allows)?idloom does not directly allow for this option, however the person buying multiple tickets will receive an email with an admin link (tokenised) which, if enabled in the configuration under ‚ÄúRegistration ‚Üí Settings‚Äù, will allow subsequent edits / modifications to their ticket.This would allow a PA to buy a ticket and assign it to him/herself only to be modified and assigned to the final recipient at a later stage.Payment & Discounts: Which payment gateways are supported on idloom?Authorize.NetAdyenBamboraCASHNetCr√©ditAgricoleCCVElavonElavon USGlobeeHiPayIngenicoMolliePayflowPaypalSagePaySIX PaymentStripeVR PaymentPayment & Discounts: How do discount codes with limited inventory work in combination with multi-buy tickets?If you have a discount code with limited numbers available, and combine this with a multi-ticket purchase there‚Äôs two variations:you allow multiple tickets to be purchased by one person:In this instance one coupon will allow you to apply the discount to all the tickets that are purchased as part of the order. Example you have tickets at a regular price of $150 and a single 50% discount code - with a person buying 2 tickets using one coupon code this will result in a total cost reduction of $150 (2x $75).you allow several consecutive registrations by the same registrant:In this instance once coupon will only allow you to buy one discounted ticket (assuming the available coupon quantity is 1). Example you have tickets at a regular price of $150 and a single 50% discount code - with a person buying 2 individualised tickets using one coupon code this will result in a total cost reduction of $75.Ops / Technical: How do I setup custom domains for both Grip Reg and Grip Engage?To do this you need a total of 4 subdomains:Grip web-> Amazon AWS - e.g.networking.xxx.comGrip Email-> mailgun e.g.messages.xxx.com(for tracking and stats)Idloom web-> idloom hosting e.g.registration.xxx.comidloom Email-> emailr e.g.tickets.xxx.comOps / Technical: How do I setup a custom email / web domain for client in idloom?Prerequisite: Customer has existing website and DNS domain registered.REGISTRATIONe.g.https://registration.future.worksregistration.future.works. 300 IN CNAMEwaf.idloom.com.EMAILe.g. registration.future.worksFollowing DNS entries must be made on client side:registration.future.works MX 10by.emailr.com.Only one SPF record per domain, so amend existing one, if any, with include instruction only "include:inc.emailr.com"registration.future.works TXT "v=spf1 include:inc.emailr.com -all"You may need to escape ";" for BIND DNS server syntax.

Title: Setting up and Using Coupons in Grip Manage

URL: https://support.grip.events/setting-up-and-using-coupons-in-grip-manage

Content:
Setting up and Using Coupons in Grip ManageThis guide explains the setup and functionality of the different types of coupons, including Ticket, Buy One Get One (BOGO) coupons, Bundle coupons, and Multi coupons. Each type serves a distinct purpose and can be configuredCreating CouponsYou can create coupons from the admin interface of Grip Manage by going to Registration > Coupons and clicking on "Add Coupon" in the top right.You'll notice that the model that opens has a dropdown for 3 options, Ticket, Bogo, Bundle. The fourth option (Multi-Coupon) can be access from the downward chevron next to the "Add Coupon" button.General Coupon Features:Coupon Code: The code that is inside the URL when coupon or needs to be entered in the registration app to apply the discount.Coupon Label: The label shown in the registration app after the coupon is applied to the ticket.Pricing OptionsFixed Price:A fixed price for the ticket you're purchasingAmount Off: A fixed discount for the ticket you're purchasingPercent Off: A percentage discount for the ticket you're purchasingWhere can the Coupon Code be entered?By going toEvent Settings > Registration > Settingsand scrolling down to the Event Curry & Taxes section you can see 4 toggles that control where coupons can be entered during the registration process.1. Ticket CouponsTicket Coupons are the most general type of Coupon and can be used to give a straightforward discount in the form of an amount off, percentage off or a different ticket price all together.2.Buy One Get One (BOGO) CouponsBOGO coupons allow attendees to receive an extra ticket free when they purchase a ticket. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step on setting up a BOGO coupon:Coupon Setup:Start by selecting the "BOGO" option under the Coupons section.Set the ticket limit to define how many tickets can be purchased with this coupon.Choose between a fixed price or a percentage discount.For example, if the limit is set to 10, a user purchasing 10 tickets will be charged for only 5, effectively receiving five tickets free.Note: If the user buys an odd number of tickets, the last ticket will not be discounted.Link to aBogo Coupon3.Bundle CouponsBundle coupons allow users to purchase multiple tickets at a fixed price.Coupon Setup:Choose the "Bundle" option when creating a coupon.Specify the fixed price and set a quantity of tickets per bundle (e.g., 3 tickets for $20).The system will enforce the bundle pricing strictly to the selected number of tickets.Example: If a bundle is set up for three tickets at $20, purchasing three tickets will apply the $20 rate. An additional ticket would not receive the discounted price unless it falls within a separate bundle.Limitations:Bundle discounts are only applied in even multiples. For example, a user buying an additional ticket outside the set bundle quantity will pay the full price for that extra ticket.Link toBundle Coupon(4 tickets for $30)4.Multi CouponsMulti Coupons are advanced coupons that allow multiple discount conditions within one code, depending on various factors such as ticket count or date of purchase.Coupon Setup:Select "Multi" as the coupon type and specify a single code that activates different discount options based on ticket quantity or specific criteria.Multi coupons require that all individual coupons within the multi-coupon are of the same type (e.g., all bundle coupons).Example: For a "Multi" coupon, configure two bundles within one coupon code:Bundle 1: 3 tickets for $20Bundle 2: 4 tickets for $30When a user redeems this code, the discount will change depending on the total tickets purchased.Testing Multi Coupons:Ensure to test multi-coupons to verify that conditions trigger correctly. If issues are detected, make sure each bundled condition follows the set rules.Link to3 for $20 and 4 for $30 multi-coupon(use the QTY number to see how the bundle switches)4.Troubleshooting Common IssuesIncorrect Pricing on Odd Numbers: In BOGO or bundle setups, any ticket purchased outside the bundle (such as an odd number purchase) will not receive a discount.Multi-Coupon Refresh: Occasionally, Multi Coupons may not update immediately after a change. A quick page refresh may resolve this.Setting Up Restrictions: The system currently requires the same type of discount in a multi-coupon; mixed types may not work correctly.5.FAQsCan I mix coupon types in a Multi Coupon?No, all discounts in a multi-coupon must be the same type to work as expected.What happens if I set up a BOGO coupon with a large ticket limit?The discount will apply in multiples of two up to the limit set. For example, if the limit is 10, up to five tickets will be discounted.Do I need to test my Multi Coupons after setup?Yes, testing ensures that the coupon applies as expected. Errors or unexpected results can often be resolved with a quick refresh.ConclusionCoupons in Grip Events allow for flexible ticket pricing options. By understanding and setting up BOGO, Bundle, and Multi Coupons appropriately, you can offer enticing deals while maintaining control over ticket limits and pricing. If any issues arise, remember to refresh and check each coupon setup thoroughly.For more help, contact our support team atsupport@grip.events.
